This project analyzes how the working class is represented in the media. It explores changes in representation over time and compares portrayals across different publishers.

**Dataset:**  
The analysis is based on a corpus of over 40,000 articles related to the working class, published between June 1, 1980, and December 31, 2024. Sources include *The New York Times* and other major media outlets.
