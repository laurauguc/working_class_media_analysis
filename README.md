# Who Counts as Working Class?
## Analysis of Media Representations

**Objective:**  
This project analyzes how the working class is represented in the media. It explores changes in representation over time and compares portrayals across different publishers.

**Dataset:**  
The analysis is based on a corpus of over 40,000 articles related to the working class, published between June 1, 1980, and December 31, 2024. Sources include *The New York Times* and other major media outlets.

**Note:** For details on how the data was parsed, cleaned, and processed, please see the separate `README.md` file in the [`data_preparation`](./data_preparation/README.md) folder.
