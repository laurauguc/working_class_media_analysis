      "At some point or another over the last decade, Democrats have won the most votes but lost national elections for the presidency, the House and the Senate.\n",
      "Partisan gerrymandering is just one of the reasons the Democrats are at such a disadvantage. But the Supreme Court’s decision on gerrymandering Thursday came as long-term political and demographic trends threaten to put Democrats at an even greater disadvantage in the Senate and perhaps also the presidency.\n",
      "It’s even possible to imagine a future in which Republicans could effectively claim a monopoly on federal power despite continued weakness in the national vote.\n",
      "Sustained minority rule — within the bounds of the Constitution — is not an imminent peril. After all, Democrats recaptured the House in November despite partisan gerrymandering. But the risk is real, and even if it does not materialize it might strain American democracy.\n",
      "So on one hand, the ruling — which said federal courts can’t bar partisan gerrymandering — merely preserves the status quo. But it also closes off one way, arguably the easiest way, that the risk of minority rule might have been reduced.\n",
      "Over the last few decades, American politics has become increasingly polarized along geographic lines. Cities now overwhelmingly back Democrats; the countryside increasingly backs Republicans, though by less lopsided margins. This kind of polarization strains representative democracies with winner-take-all voting systems, since even modest alternations in district or state lines can produce very different results.\n",
      "These biases can be unintentional. Democrats, for instance, lost the 2016 election by the margin of the Florida Panhandle and Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, and the 2000 election by the margin of the Panhandle. It’s an accident of 19th-century history that these regions did not end up being part of Alabama and Wisconsin instead.\n",
      "But even more consequential shifts can result from the intentional manipulation of district lines for partisan gain.\n",
      "Either party can benefit from partisan gerrymandering. But Republicans generally have an easier time of it than Democrats, who waste millions of votes by winning lopsided margins in urban districts that pad their popular vote tallies without yielding additional seats. The G.O.P., in contrast, wastes fewer votes in the countryside, where Republicans generally win by smaller margins. \n",
      "There is no guarantee that this bias will persist. If Republicans keep gaining in rural areas and Democrats keep gaining in the suburbs, Republicans might find themselves at an underlying disadvantage in the House. \n",
      "And Democrats have one advantage of their own, in translating their votes to seats in the House: their ability to win districts with relatively few voters, often in heavily Latino areas with low citizenship rates, high numbers of children and low turnout. This advantage seems likelier to endure after the Supreme Court ruled against the Trump administration on adding a citizenship question to the census, which might have allowed states to draw districts based on the number of eligible voters, not the total population.  (The administration has not given up in this effort, with President Trump saying the census may be delayed.) \n",
      "But for now the overall bias benefits Republicans, and partisan gerrymandering often increases this effect. In blue-leaning states, it is easy enough for Republican governments to draw heavily Democratic districts, anchored in cities, then divvy up the rest of a state to their advantage, as they did in Pennsylvania or Michigan. In red-leaning states, they can break up cities into multiple Republican-leaning districts, as they have in Utah or Ohio. Over all, gerrymandering probably gives the Republicans about 10 more seats than they would have otherwise. \n",
      "In an era of growing geographic polarization, these gerrymanders can be quite durable and can even become more effective over time. In 2018, Republican state legislative maps easily survived a Democratic wave election in states like Michigan and Wisconsin. \n",
      "Other sources of disadvantage for large states\n",
      "At the same time, the American electoral system disadvantages the party of populous states through the Senate and, to a lesser degree, the Electoral College. Every state gets two senators, regardless of population. \n",
      "That has wound up disadvantaging Democrats as American electoral politics have polarized along geographic lines, since they tend to excel in the relatively populous states with big cities. \n",
      "The Republican Senate advantage is similar to the Republican edge in the U.S. House, even though there’s no gerrymandering involved. The Democrats failed to take the Senate in 2018 despite favorable political conditions in part for this reason.\n",
      "The Democratic Electoral College disadvantage is more a product of bad luck than geography. In a decade or two, perhaps the oddities of state lines might wind up working to Democrats’ advantage. If Texas turns blue, for instance, they’ll benefit from the fact that it didn’t decide to divide itself into five states. But just because it’s bad luck for the Democrats doesn’t mean it’s not a real disadvantage.\n",
      "Let’s suppose that Hillary Clinton had won the presidency in 2016. With the typical midterm headwinds for the party in power (in this case the Democrats), it’s possible that Republicans could have won a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate in 2018 by reaching 60 seats. \n",
      "In that kind of political environment, they would have also most likely controlled the redistricting process in the crucial states again in 2020, and probably held full control of state government in nearly two-thirds of states, placing them close to what they would have needed to unilaterally amend the Constitution, had they then won the presidency in 2020. They could have even probably succeeded in awarding electoral votes by congressional district, as was common fairly early in the country’s history and as some Republicans proposed doing after President Obama’s 2012 victory.\n",
      "Republicans could gain an even greater edge in the Senate and the Electoral College than exists today. All it would take is a continuation of current trends, with the Rust Belt turning Republican before the Sun Belt turns blue. Total Republican control of government — say, all three branches with a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate — wouldn’t be hard to imagine even with a fairly competitive national vote. Democrats could find themselves locked out of the Senate for prolonged periods, and perhaps take only fleeting control of the House in midterm election years.\n",
      "It would be hard for partisan gerrymandering to completely lock Democrats out of control of the House of Representatives, but you couldn’t rule it out. In terms of gerrymandering, there are certainly states where Republicans could go even further than they do today. \n",
      "Trends don’t have to continue\n",
      "Of course, there’s no guarantee that the Democrats face a persistent and deep structural disadvantage. Democrats have incentive to broaden their appeal and break the cycle of partisan polarization, as they did in the 2018 midterm election. Perhaps they will do so, or maybe something else will change the balance. (It is foolish to assume that current trends will continue indefinitely.)\n",
      "The long-predicted “emerging Democratic majority” may never actually materialize, but the same trends could be enough to break an inexorable slide toward a large Republican structural advantage, whether it’s a breakthrough in Texas or even a blue Montana and blue Alaska brimming with West Coast expatriates by 2040. Stranger things have happened.\n",
      "But it is also possible that partisan and racial polarization deepen further. The leftward drift of Democratic voters, and the party’s growing diversity and level of educational attainment, make it harder for them to reach out to white, conservative working-class voters. The demographic pressures facing Republicans could push them to take more extreme steps to preserve power, like even harsher gerrymanders. \n",
      "As Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in his majority opinion, Democrats have alternative, potential remedies to partisan gerrymandering, whether through referendums or state courts. This has already happened, to some extent, in a number of states, like California, Pennsylvania and Florida. It is likely to happen in even more states in the coming years, but it might not always be a realistic short-term option for reformers, depending on state laws and courts.\n",
      "Partisan gerrymandering is far from the only thing that drives the risk of persistent structural imbalances in American elections. You could even make the case that it’s the least important factor. But it is one factor, and it was the factor that was easiest to imagine disappearing, until Thursday’s ruling.\n",

      "Publisher: The New York Times \n",
      "Date: 2015-11-26\n",
      "Section: MOVIES\n",
      "Length: 680 words words\n",
      "Body preview: \"Iraqi Odyssey,\" a two-and-a-half-hour personal history written and directed by the Swiss filmmaker            Samir (full name, Samir Jamal Aldin), is the kind of documentary whose length and complexity make you approach it with some apprehension. Watching it is like slowly leafing through a giant scrapbook whose contents include the individual stories of a large extended family.\n",
      "Buffeted by war and political upheaval, Samir's relatives, who are seen at different ages and in different places, belong to the Jamal Aldin clan, a well-educated line of professionals who trace their ancestry to the Prophet Muhammad. They became secularists during the period, beginning in the 1920s, of British rule. Today they belong to a diaspora of Iraqi émigrés scattered across the globe. Family members have landed in places as far-flung as Auckland, New Zealand; Buffalo; London; and Zurich, where Samir settled with his Swiss wife. Late in the movie, Samir remarks with some bitterness that since settling there, he hasn't made a single friend.\n",
      "To begin to grasp the magnitude of the family's collective travels would take at least two viewings of the film accompanied by a who's-who chart of its members and their peregrinations.\n",
      "For American audiences, conditioned to view Iraq through the lens of contemporary wartime journalism as a primitive fractious land of Shiites, Sunnis and other sects in continual conflict, the documentary will be a revelation. Not so long ago Iraq was much more westernized than it is today, and scenes of Iraqis in Western garb, living comfortable middle-class lives in happier times, puts a lump in your throat.\n",
      "Samir playfully compares the family history to Homer's \"Odyssey,\" and throughout the movie there are flashes of scenes from \"Ulysses,\" a 1955 movie starring Kirk Douglas. If \"Iraqi Odyssey\" is a Homeric parable, he suggests, Iraq is the equivalent of Penelope, patiently waiting for Odysseus to return. But in this version Penelope loses patience and marries one of her suitors. There isn't a triumphant homecoming, and it is doubtful whether, given all that has happened, such a homecoming is possible, but one can still dream. There is a joyful family reunion; it is not on Iraqi soil but in Switzerland.\n",
      "The family history is inseparable from the history of the country. In the 1950s, members of the clan flirted with Communism, but they weren't infatuated with Marxist ideology so much as encouraged by the Communists' determination to improve the lives of the working class. At a crucial turning point, one family member recalls, the Baath Party, which was solidifying its power, out of which emerged Saddam Hussein, waited in vain for help from the Soviet Union. He theorizes that the outcome of the Cuban missile crisis prevented the Soviets from intervening; they didn't want another confrontation with the United States.\n",
      "From here, things go mostly downhill. Hussein's rise led to Iraq's pointless eight-year war with Iran, and the worsening horrors of his dictatorship, followed by the American invasion of the country. For all the politics described in the film, \"Iraqi Odyssey\" never becomes bogged down in strident rhetoric and analysis, although the family members who chose to settle in the Soviet Union instead of Britain regret their decision.\n",
      "The members of the Jamal Aldin clan are resilient, articulate, intelligent, attractive and cosmopolitan. They make the best of a bad situation. What is remarkable is the clan's cohesion, despite being separated by thousands of miles. They sadly acknowledge that the homeland they were forced to flee barely exists anymore. The country, one family member says, has \"gone back 500 years.\"\n",
      "\"Iraqi Odyssey\" is not rated. Running time: 2 hours 43 minutes.\n",

      "Title: Review: Great Pretenders Pocket Laughs in ‘The Nap’\n",
      "Publisher: The New York Times \n",
      "Date: 2018-09-27\n",
      "Section: THEATER\n",
      "Length: 1148 words words\n",
      "Body preview: When you’re feeling burned-out, fed-up and generally disgusted — like now, maybe? — there’s nothing more therapeutic than a tickling session at the theater. Relax, it involves no squirmy physical contact.\n",
      "I mean the sort of tickling administered by a team of master farceurs who frisk you into a state of sustained laughter, as involuntary and contented as the purr of a kitten at play. It’s the noise being artfully coaxed from audiences by the British dramatist Richard Bean and a precision-tooled ensemble of great pretenders at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater.\n",
      "That’s where Mr. Bean’s delicious new comedy “The Nap” opened on Thursday night, directed with an assured balance of blatancy and subtlety by Daniel Sullivan. While the name of this Manhattan Theater Club production might seem to promise a snooze, the title refers not to a siesta but to the baize surface of a snooker table — or specifically to the resistance it gives to the balls that skim across it.\n",
      "Does that sound too esoteric? Don’t worry if you’re unacquainted with the arcana of this British cousin of billiards and pool. Not speaking snookerese is no disadvantage in experiencing Mr. Bean’s story of a young working-class phenom from Sheffield and the criminal friends and relations who love (and nearly destroy) him.\n",
      "Besides, the dominant game of “The Nap” isn’t snooker. It’s farce. And like most sports, farce requires from its players hair-trigger timing and an intuitive grasp of the physics of bodies in motion. Its success is achieved not by sustained assault but by dexterity, and by always keeping the other guy (in this case, the audience) off guard.\n",
      "The best examples of the genre on Broadway in recent years have originated in Britain. For the form at its most elemental, there’s the current demolition derby called “The Play That Goes Wrong.” But the sterling English-language farce of this century is            Mr. Bean’s “One Man, Two Guvnors” (2012), the commedia dell’arte-style caper that made an American star of James Corden.\n",
      "“The Nap” is less frenetically funny than “One Man,” and more modest in scale. But it shares with its predecessor a fondness for the subterfuges and archetypes of classic farce, which Mr. Bean translates fluently into modern-day terms.\n",
      "Our idealistic hero, Dylan Spokes (Ben Schnetzer), is a blue-collar lad with the kind of back story that makes television producers drool. Dylan was brought up by his dad, Bobby (John Ellison Conlee), who selflessly sold recreational drugs to finance a snooker shed in the backyard, where the boy could hone his craft.\n",
      "Dylan knows that without snooker, he’d probably be on the dole and grifting, like his dear old mom, Stella (Johanna Day as squalor incarnate). “Without snooker, what am I?” he asks. “I’m cooking meth, I’m on welfare, I’m getting me legs blown off in Afghan.”\n",
      "But enough of the anthropology, except to say that it informs Dylan’s commitment to his sport. But as his star ascends — with the possibility of his reaching the world championship finals — temptations block his path.\n",
      "First of all, there’s his sponsor, the expensively dressed, one-armed, transgender Waxy Bush (Alexandra Billings in a sensational Broadway debut), who, before her transition, dated Dylan’s mum. Waxy now wants her protégé to throw a frame (or round) in his next big match to appease some mysterious Philippine gamblers.\n",
      "Word of possible foul play has already reached the ears of Mohammad Butt (a sublimely fatuous Bhavesh Patel), the Integrity Officer for International Sports Security, who shows up in the Sheffield legion hall where Dylan is practicing. (David Rockwell did the sociologically specific sets and Kaye Voyce the spot on, tacky costumes.) Mo is accompanied by a distractingly attractive police detective (and former pole dancer), Eleanor Lavery (Heather Lind).\n",
      "Will the noble, vegetarian Dylan be able to withstand the onslaughts upon his integrity? After all, the hungry fellow refuses a shrimp sandwich, saying he eats nothing with a brain, causing Bobby to remark, “They’re shrimp. They’re not novelists.”\n",
      "Cheering Dylan on, albeit in different directions, are Stella and her malodorous new boyfriend, Danny Killeen (Thomas Jay Ryan), and Dylan’s flashy agent, Tony DanLino (Max Gordon Moore, a riot of jittery, sincere phoniness), who of course would address Dylan as Dylzo.\n",
      "As is customary in such plays, each character has some signal, off-center trait that is worn like an ID tag, which is embellished, with variations, ad infinitum.\n",
      "Tony is the epithet-slinging fabulist. Stella keeps coming up with whiny “poor me” rationalizations for her criminal acts. And Waxy is the play’s resident Ms. Malaprop, who misquotes Shakespeare and refers to Dylan as a “child effigy.” Ms. Billings, a marvel of glamorous menace, delivers such mangling with a smooth, sinister confidence that keeps the others from laughing. Not us, though.\n",
      "Ms. Lind — who has appeared as a docile Shakespearean heroine in Public Theater productions — shows a wicked comic wit here as a badge-toting femme fatale. And as the bewildered straight man to everybody else, Mr. Schnetzer more than holds his own, finding intriguing ambivalence within Dylan’s virtuous persona and also proving himself a dab hand at snooker.\n",
      "The cast members shape their characters with just enough comic exaggeration to stay credible and also to suggest that not everyone is what she or he seems. For “The Nap” is also a comedy of deception, including self-deception, and the sort of willful, hilarious misunderstandings that have always been a basis for slapstick. (In this case, they include not one but two anarchic variations of movie-title guessing games.)\n",
      "The play’s second, shorter act, in which all is revealed, isn’t as satisfying as the first, and it rushes its final moments into anticlimax. On the other hand, where else are you going to be able to watch a live snooker game (with video simulcast) in which you feel so personally invested?\n",
      "That’s when Dylan faces off against two champions (both played by the real snooker ace Ahmed Aly Elsayed), in matches described by two unseen commentators. With their time-filling, vacuous babble, these voices will be familiar to anyone who follows sports on television. And just in case snooker still confuses you, these announcers keep explaining its rules, with priceless condescension, to unenlightened listeners.\n",
      "They include those who might be “on the internet in Antarctica” or “on a canoe in Tahiti.” Those at the Friedman Theater, however, know that no matter how the match ends, this gratifyingly silly show has — now, what’s the term? — potted all its balls.\n",

      "Body preview: Along Fifth Avenue, what was once a strip of empty storefronts, bodegas and Chinese restaurants with bulletproof windows is changing into one of Brooklyn's most eclectic commercial thoroughfares.\n",
      "Several cafes, a new herb store offering root tonics and a number of antique stores have sprouted along Fifth Avenue, the main artery of the \"other\" Park Slope, a working-class neighborhood that was once Italian and that is now largely Hispanic. Near St. John's Place, Carmel Roker is doing a brisk business in roti and coco bread. An old funeral parlor on Fifth and President Street is now Mike & Tony's, a steak and cigar parlor. A few blocks south, a gay bar, an organic meat market and a shop specializing in Negro Baseball League memorabilia have opened in the last year.\n",
      "Real estate agents, business people and community leaders say the renewal of Fifth Avenue, particularly between Flatbush and Ninth Street, is in large part due to rents that are much lower than on Seventh and Flatbush nearby.\n",
      "And several dilapidated buildings have been rehabilitated in the last year with an infusion of public dollars. On the corner of Garfield Place, for instance, an abandoned building that was literally raining bricks has been renovated by the Fifth Avenue Committee, a community group, into apartments for low-income families. Last December, Irene Lore, the owner of Aunt Suzie's restaurant, turned the ground floor of the apartment building into Luna Park, a cafe and ice cream parlor.\n",
      "To be sure, Fifth Avenue isn't trendy TriBeCa yet, or even the next Seventh Avenue, Park Slope's affluent marketplace two blocks east. But shopkeepers like Ms. Roker, a Haitian immigrant who opened Carmel's Bakery three years ago, are itching to go upscale.\n",
      "\"I'd like Fifth Avenue to be like Seventh Avenue,\" she said, standing behind a counter laden with coconut cake and sweet-potato pies. \"Before, a business would open and close very quickly. Now you see business coming, little bit by little bit.\"\n",
      "But Brad Lander, executive director of the Fifth Avenue Committee, is more guarded about the prospect of swift gentrification.\n",
      "\"The mission of the Fifth Avenue Committee is to preserve the racial and economic diversity of lower Park Slope and to insure that all residents benefit from the area's development,\" he said, \"which means to make sure low-income people are not displaced.\"\n",
      "In this respect, Fifth Avenue faces a challenge not uncommon in New York City neighborhoods: how to revitalize a somewhat rundown strip without pushing it beyond the reach of the mostly working-class families who live nearby. Mr. Lander's solution is to make sure that residential rents remain affordable.\n",
      "It was precisely Fifth Avenue's lower rents and decidedly funkier flavor that drew Catherine Blake, a former carpenter, from Windsor Terrace. She and a partner, Christine Marinoni, are sprucing up a storefront on the corner of Sackett Street and Fifth Avenue and turning it into the Rising Cafe. The restaurant, scheduled to open later this month, will serve coffee, snacks, wine, beer and, Ms. Blake hopes, poetry and song.\n",
      "\"I much prefer the atmosphere down here,\" she said. \"There's a funkier feel. It's a little more creative and not as stuffy as Seventh Avenue.\"   SOMINI SENGUPTA\n",

      "Body preview: Eugenio Duval is poised to rise with, or be crushed by, the good times descending on his lower Park Slope street corner. The problem for the 39-year-old bodega owner is deciding what to stock his shelves with.\n",
      "In a 30-minute period last week, Mr. Duval's store near the corner of Seventh and Prospect Avenues sold a lottery ticket to a middle-class Hispanic woman, cigarettes to an elderly white woman, baby formula to a young black father and two pints of malt liquor to a white working-class couple. But he was stumped by the request of a long-haired young man in his 20's. \"Do you have any organic eggs?\" the man asked politely.\n",
      "Mr. Duval, a Dominican immigrant, was stumped. He and the owners of the other new businesses opening up in the South Slope are eager to ride the tide of commercial growth spreading down from the North Slope, but none is quite sure how to do it. The same area started to grow in the 1980's but then bottomed out. Now, trendier businesses, drawn by rents that their owners say can be half that of North Slope properties, are moving in, following the influx of higher-income tenants to apartments south of Ninth Street.\n",
      "While real-estate brokers in the neighborhood predict that a boom in the area will draw more upscale businesses with a wealthier clientele, owners of both old and new businesses say the situation right now is a gamble. For Mr. Duval and other merchants who cater to working-class customers, the danger is they will fail to adapt and be driven out of their suddenly prime locations.\n",
      "For Adiz Fernandez, a 23-year-old who along with her boyfriend turned a boarded-up storefront into the stylish Computer Caffe, the danger is that she is too far ahead of the neighborhood. \"I see it as a developing area,\" she said as a customer ordered a cappuccino. \"Four new businesses have opened here.\"\n",
      "In the last few months, a hair salon called Bohemia has opened up on Seventh Avenue and 15th Street next door to the Computer Caffe, where customers can use computers while sipping coffee. On the other side of the avenue, Sanctuary, a gay and lesbian bar, is opening, and an abandoned storefront is being turned into a French restaurant. A mountain bike store and cigar store and smoking salon have also opened nearby.\n",
      "Across the street from the Computer Caffe, V & E Beverage's cash register is still encased in floor-to-ceiling bulletproof glass. After surviving the neighborhood's bad times, Enrique Torrellas, manager of the family-owned liquor store for the last seven years, fears being forced out of business. If he increases his prices, he predicted, his customers will turn to discount liquor stores. \"We'll see what happens next year,\" Mr. Torrellas said. \"Maybe we'll leave.\"\n",
      "Lori Falco, the 35-year-old owner of See-Gar, a cigar store, smoking salon and gift shop that opened last month, fears the same rising rents, but hopes gentrification is not inevitable. She said she opened the store on Seventh Avenue near 13th Street because it was a growing area, but also because of Park Slope's diversity, which she said she would hate to see disappear. Her cigars range from 80 cents to $13 each.\n",
      "\"I have a 70-year-old man who comes in here and loves his 89-cent cigars,\" she said. \"It's just nice when you go from an old man like that to a dad with a kid to a doctor to a construction worker to a woman who wants to try cigars.\"   DAVID ROHDE\n",

      "  ALPHA BLONDY (Tuesday) Plenty of pop rebels -- even a few conservatives -- have released albums called ''Revolution.'' Few have taken the word more seriously than Alpha Blondy, an outspoken reggae singer from the Ivory Coast who also has albums with more unusual titles like ''Apartheid Is Nazism'' and ''Yitzhak Rabin.'' ''Brigadier Sabari,'' his account of police brutality in Abidjan, has earned the approval of both the Wailers and Daft Punk. The location for the show -- a free SummerStage presentation -- is appropriate. At 7 p.m., Marcus Garvey Park, Madison Avenue and 122nd Street, East Harlem, summerstage.org. (Nick Murray)\n",
      "  BLACK SABBATH (Wednesday) Ozzy Osbourne played his first farewell tour in 1992. He played his first comeback tour -- the ''Retirement Sucks Tour'' -- three years later. So if Black Sabbath really does fulfill its promise and calls it quits after this 25-country heavy-metal victory lap, credit will have to go only to the aging process -- and the various techniques Mr. Osbourne has used to speed it up. At 7:30 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, 800-745-3000, nikonjonesbeach.com. (Murray)\n",
      "  BLINK-182 (Saturday and Wednesday) Harlan Howard once described country music as three chords and the truth. Blink-182 proved that pop-punk could be even less. The group, a trio from California, filled its music with adolescent bluster and mischief, and the combination proved so successful that the two remaining members, Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker, are still recreating it. Both men are in their 40s. This sort of looking back requires either a lot of maturity, or none at all. With All Time Low and A Day to Remember. Saturday at 7 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, 800-745-3000, nikonjonesbeach.com.

On ''New Americana,'' her vision of a utopia, queer, working-class misfits remake their hometown after the rich leave for summer vacation. ''We don't feel like outsiders at all,'' she concludes once the deed is done. This will ring especially true when sung inside Madison Square Garden.

Their music, industrial rave gone digital, will sound better after dark. ''Proto,'' the pair's collaborative LP, repeats a highly effective formula, rendering ominous synth surfaces before puncturing them with almost violent percussive blasts. At 12 p.m., MoMA PS1, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, 718-784-2084, ps1.org. At 10 p.m., Slake, 251 West 30th Street, 212-695-8970, slakenyc.com. (Murray)\n",
      "  PITBULL (Saturday) Pitbull may be the only rapper whose albums could pass for Naomi Klein tomes. On ''Global Warming,'' ''Globalization,'' ''Rebelution'' and, truest of all, ''Money Is Still a Major Issue,'' the M.C. slowly grew into something more. He now offers himself up as party host, promoter, entertainer and guest, all in one, delivering each lyric as if it were a toast at a wedding. This bash will open with sets from the Bronx bachata singer Prince Royce, a slightly more sensual performer, and Farruko. At 7 p.m., Prudential Center, 165 Mulberry Street, Newark, 800-745-3000, prucenter.com. (Murray)\n",
      "  PJ HARVEY (Monday and Tuesday) Ms. Harvey began touring behind her latest release, ''The Hope Six Demolition Project,'' this summer, but the album's recording was itself a performance, done publicly, behind glass walls, for an art installation at Somerset House in London. The sessions produced her best live album in years, a collection of political rock songs that will sound even better loud and without barriers.

That's time that could have been spent listening to Dawn Richard, a former ''Making the Band'' contestant who resurrected her career with a string of releases that pick up where Kelis's ''Flesh Tone'' left off, wringing cold electro-soul from dance beats that embrace the unexpected.

Björk  (Sunday, Wednesday, March 28 and April 1) It is startling to hear Björk -- an artist who specializes in mercurial, brilliant electro-symphonics and opaquely cerebral lyrics -- expose her heart so thoroughly on her morose new album, ''Vulnicura.'' Yet when this Icelandic star poses the devastating question, ''Did I love you too much?/Devotion bent me broken,'' on the song ''Black Lake'' -- over heavy, elegiac strings, warped voices and fractured synth production from the upstart talent Arca -- she creates her finest art in a decade. Her sorrow is terrible and gorgeous. Sunday at 3 p.m., Kings Theater, 1027 Flatbush Avenue, near Tilden Avenue, Brooklyn, ticketmaster.com.

      "  Action Bronson  (Tuesday and Wednesday) This professional chef-cum-rapper from Queens redirects his voracity toward the fleet rhyme composition of the Wu-Tang Clan and the foodie jargon (not to mention the irascibility) of Anthony Bourdain. His full-length 2011 debut, ''Dr. Lecter,'' shows where his heart is in the tracks ''Brunch,'' ''Shiraz'' and ''Jerk Chicken.'' He is touring in support of the album ''Mr. Wonderful,'' which will be released on Tuesday. At 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, 800-745-3000, terminal5nyc.com. (Anderson)\n",
      "  Neil Diamond  (Thursday) This ''Sweet Caroline'' crooner's easygoing humor has informed his career for the past 50-odd years, and he continues to be a youthful presence onstage. His most recent studio album, ''Melody Road,'' released last year, was a sunny, soft-rock ode to matrimony from this newly remarried artist.

      "  Fifth Harmony  (Monday) A girl group forged by the ''X Factor'' impresario Simon Cowell, Fifth Harmony has drawn many early comparisons to One Direction, which sprang from the same origins. The surefooted R&B, pop effervescence and satiny harmonies on ''Reflection,'' the group's debut studio album, indicate a globe-trotting future success all its own.

On March 30, he will duet with Brian Wilson at the Fonda Theater in Los Angeles as part of ''Brian Fest,'' a celebration of Mr. Wilson's music. With Donald Cumming.

      "  Ariana Grande  (Friday and Saturday) This young pop singer leapt from Nickelodeon into full, unfettered pop stardom last year with the release of her second album, ''My Everything.'' She deserved it after her white-knuckle job in 2013: opening for Justin Bieber. Expect her to flip her formidable ponytail through peppy, melismatic renditions of her Top 10 hits ''Break Free,'' ''Problem'' and ''Love Me Harder.''

Debbie Harry  (Fridays, Saturdays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, through April 4) In the 1970s, when Ms. Harry and her band Blondie first trod CBGB's sticky boards, she was the prototype of the glamorous punk: a woman full of righteous conviction who also radiated poise. Now, one year after the band celebrated its 40th anniversary and released the album ''Ghosts of Download,'' she takes to the regal Café Carlyle on the Upper East Side for a short residency. It's a long way from the East Village, but a fitting place for a rock eminence. Fridays at 8:45 p.m. and 10:45 p.m.; Saturdays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, at 8:45 p.m.; Café Carlyle, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, 212-744-1600, thecarlyle.com. (Anderson)\n",
      "  Ms. Lauryn Hill  (Friday, Saturday and Wednesday) Ms. Hill seems to be warming to local showmanship; in recent years, she has had a handful of concerts at small clubs. Now she'll perform a few acoustic sets at City Winery and Highline Ballroom, which may be more ideal settings for this talented singer and rapper: In his review of one of her outings last year, Jon Pareles lamented that she ''was often buried in the mix of her band's hyperactive funk.'' Friday and Saturday at 9 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, 212-414-5994, highlineballroom.com.

      "  Hozier (Sunday) Something's in the air in Ireland: two of its musical representatives have blatant religious fixations. The brooding singer Hozier, whose real name is Andrew Hozier-Byrne, broke into American radio and graced the stage of ''Saturday Night Live'' with his first single, ''Take Me to Church,'' a sultry, bracing appraisal of love and the hypocrisy of religion. The song shouldn't be confused with his countrywoman Sinead O'Connor's identically titled track, a yearning for redemptive love. With George Ezra. At 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, 800-745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Anderson)\n",

Their music is an ecstatic whirl of Yoruba chants, French and English purrs, sparse electronic beats, Cajón drums and a lot of preternatural tenacity. The duo's self-titled debut album, which was recently released on XL, is a remarkable first outing. With Flo Morrissey.

The discordant dance-pop of her 2012 album, ''Electra Heart,'' hit No. 1 in Britain; the follow-up, ''Froot,'' landed this month.

Her new album, ''Short Movie,'' will be released in Britain on the day of this show, and the following day in the States.

      "  The Month in Cabaret (through April 4) The most anticipated event of cabaret's high season is Debbie Harry's already sold-out engagement at Café Carlyle, from Tuesday through April 4. On the heels of Buster Poindexter's run there, it is proof positive that downtown has crashed the gates of uptown and that the punk-rock revolution, absorbed by the mainstream, now qualifies as rock nostalgia. Before that, Herb Alpert and Lani Hall are at the Café through Saturday with a mixture of light pop-jazz built around Mr. Alpert's burbling trumpet and Ms. Hall's sultry voice.

      "I’ve been fascinated by the fight over the baby boomers. You maybe remember OK, boomer, this dismissal of boomer politics that got popular on the internet for a minute and drove boomers totally crazy. That came, of course, during Donald Trump’s presidency. And it reflected frustration in having our fourth boomer president.\n",
      "And then it’s not like there was — well, there was a bit of a generational handover, actually. Joe Biden — he’s not a boomer. He’s born a few years before the boomers. But I don’t think that’s the kind of generational handover a lot of young people were looking for, which I think gets to the point of this generational frustration. There is a sense — and not just a sense, a reality — that America’s elder generations have kept a hammerlock on power.\n",
      "They’ve not used that power, in many cases, all that wisely. You look at the climate, for instance. And the world they’re leaving, the economy they’re leaving, is not in great shape. And even now, if you look at how a lot of boomers vote, there’s a feeling among the young that they are the ones blocking progress on these issues. And this is a live fight. I mean, if you just turned on “Saturday Night Live” the other night, you heard it.\n",
      "^ARCHIVED RECORDING^: (SINGING) Baby boomers, greatest generation. You got all the money, now we got the vaccination. Crash the economy three whole times. But when it comes to the vax, we the first in line. Got a job out of college, no student debt. Retirement funded 100 percent. Voted for Trump —\n",
      "EZRA KLEIN: So I’ve been wanting to do a show on this. First, is it useful to talk about this at all? Generations are big and diverse. What’s the point in talking in categories of that size? But then also, what is the critique at its core? I mean, you don’t get a lot out of OK boomer. Whenever there’s this much anger, though, lasting for this much time and emerging in this many cultural forms, you got to assume there’s something real there, something worth trying to understand on its own terms.\n",
      "But one thing about it is, it’s not just one critique of the boomers. There’s a left critique that’s more about economics and power, and then a right critique that, at least usually, is more about cultural libertinism and individualism and institutional decay. So I wanted to put these critiques together to see if they added up to something coherent. Or maybe it’s just a bunch of carping millennials. And I say that as an often carping millennial.\n",
      "Jill Filipovic is a writer, commentator, a lawyer, and she’s the author of the book “OK, Boomer, Let’s Talk How My Generation Got Left Behind,” which is a very nice encapsulation of the economic case for millennial rage. Helen Andrews is a senior editor at The American Conservative and author of “Boomers, The Men and Women Who Promised Freedom and Delivered Disaster,” which is a pretty searing critique from the right. As always, my email is ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com Here we go.\n",
      "So welcome, both of you, to the show. Helen, I want to begin with you. Why is generational analysis valuable? I mean, we’re dealing with pretty arbitrary time periods. Generations, they contain multitudes. So why are boomers or any other age cohort a useful descriptive category for understanding American society?\n",
      "HELEN ANDREWS: The clue that first got me thinking that the boomers might be worth analyzing as a generation rather than through historical events that they happened to be around for was that the 1960s was a global phenomenon. A lot of people attribute ’60s protests in the United States to the various issues that they centered around, things like the anti-war movement. But you saw the same kinds of student protests in countries that didn’t have a draft or in countries where they had completely different records in World War II. And the parent-child dynamic was just totally alien to what it was in the United States.\n",
      "So that got me thinking that the ’60s might have been a product just of the youth generation having such demographic heft, there being just so many more young people around. And that was the reason the ’60s protests took the form they did and were so universal across the civilized world. And then I started following the boomers through their political career. And you saw the same kinds of coincidences across the globe as they came into power in the 1990s. You saw neoliberal triangulators, who were trying to reconcile the left and capitalism, and the same types of leaders like Tony Blair and Bill Clinton in different places.\n",
      "So any phenomenon that is happening in countries that have very different histories and issues sets, but similar demographic bulges, I thought was an indication that generations were worth looking at as generations.\n",
      "EZRA KLEIN: So I can buy that. So then, Jill, let’s say I’m a boomer who thinks my generation wasn’t really that bad. And I’m tired of everybody yelling at me. I mean, sure, every generation, we make a few mistakes. But ultimately, we boomers, we left the world better than we found it. And the problem is that millennials are just particularly self-pitying, and they just want to blame the fact that life is hard on everyone else. Convince me I’m wrong.\n",
      "JILL FILIPOVIC: Well, that’s pretty much the same thing that people said about the boomers when they were young, right? There is a whole book written about them called “The Culture of Narcissism.” If you read Helen’s book, it certainly draws on a lot of the descriptions of boomers when they were young people. I think one thing that’s very poorly understood about the boomer generation — and perhaps this is me being slightly defensive of them — is that they’re an incredibly politically polarized generation.\n",
      "So boomers, much more so than millennials, much more so than the silent generation, more so even than Gen Xers, are really split politically down the middle between liberals and conservatives. And I think what we’ve actually seen and what I hear, especially from liberal boomers, is the sense of, well, wait a minute. We were trying to make the world a better place. And then there were political forces who we didn’t vote for who may have been part of our cohort, who now you’re using to blame our entire generation.\n",
      "There’s some fairness to that defensiveness. That said, I would say, liberal boomers kind of won the culture. Conservative and more moderate boomers won American politics. And so the generation wide legacy, yes, does have some positives. But overwhelmingly, we’re now living on a planet that’s flooding and burning. So I think it’s a little hard to say that boomers left it better than they found it.\n",
      "EZRA KLEIN: On the flooding and burning point — and I guess I’ll send this one to Helen, but it’s really for both — one thing I thought about, reading both of your books, is how much the boomers are actually a stand-in for technological change, some of which they generate and some of which they didn’t. I mean, the planet is burning. But the driving of fossil fuels as the way you power economies, I mean, that predates the boomers. And then, obviously, it grows during their heyday.\n",
      "But a lot of the things that I think they get tagged for come from scientific advances that they weren’t even the ones to necessarily create. I mean, a lot of the sexual politics changes come from the pill. A lot of — and this is a theme of your book, Helen — a lot of social changes come from television. I mean, how much are boomers, Helen, simply the generation that happened to be largest and then in power when a lot of the electricity revolutions innovations came into full flower?\n",
      "HELEN ANDREWS: I don’t think you can blame technology for the way the world is today and the wreckage that the boomers left us. For example, when we talk about the world today being a lot tougher for millennials than it was for the boomers, one of the things we’re talking about is the loss of power on the part of the working class. Their wages are not growing the way that they used to in the days of the boomers. A one-income family can’t make it the way that they could in the time of the boomers.\n",
      "Some of that is attributable to technology, but a lot of that is due to changes in what the boomers did to the left. That is, the boomers were the generation of the new left. And the reason they called themselves that is because they were rebelling against the old left. They deliberately wanted the left-wing party in the western democracies not to stand for working class people and unions, but rather to stand for identity politics type interests. The hinge moment in America for that is the reforms to the Democratic National Convention in 1972, when they nominated George McGovern.\n",
      "The way that delegates were chosen was then tilted toward or to favor identity politics. So the boomers made a choice to have their left-wing party champion identity politics, rather than working class people and unions. And so that’s the reason why the working class was then so vulnerable to these technological changes. The technological changes would have happened either way. But I think they would have had better defenders in the left-wing parties if the boomers hadn’t replaced the old left with their new left.\n",
      "EZRA KLEIN: Is this what you think they did wrong? I mean, my understanding of your take on the boomers is that they unleashed a kind of cultural reckoning on America. And you do talk about the new left questions in the book, but you’re a Trum...\n",

      "EZRA KLEIN: Russia invaded Ukraine 15 months ago. For a time following the invasion, it was all the world could talk about. It’s all the show could talk about. And now, as happens with a lot of stories huge at the outset, now the Russia-Ukraine war is treated as one news story — I mean, a major one — but one news story among many.\n",
      "But it’s still more than that. It’s a kind of hyper story. There is the conflict itself, which matters enormously. And then there’s the way it’s reshaping global geopolitics and the relationships and balancing of the great powers. Early in the invasion, I had Fareed Zakaria on to talk about the way it felt at that moment like we were re-entering an age of great power conflict. So I wanted to have him back on now to discuss where the war is now, what the prospects and possibilities of its end might be, and how it’s changed the relationships and competition between America and Europe and China and India among others.\n",
      "Zakaria, of course, is host of the CNN show, “Fareed Zakaria GPS.” He’s a columnist for The Washington Post and the author of many, many books, including, most recently “10 Lessons for a Post-Pandemic World.” As always, my email for our guest suggestions, thoughts, et cetera, ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com\n",
      "Fareed Zakaria, welcome back to the show.\n",
      "FAREED ZAKARIA: Always a pleasure, Ezra.\n",
      "EZRA KLEIN: So we last talked on the show in March 2022. This was right after Russia invaded Ukraine. So give me your overview of where that conflict stands now.\n",
      "FAREED ZAKARIA: I think I said this to you the last time, but it’s worth pointing out that what this represents is two things, the Russian invasion of Ukraine. First, it is the most frontal challenge to the post-Cold War world order created sort of serendipitously and partly by design by the United States largely after the collapse of communism, because, at that point, one of the things that was settled was the post-Soviet space.\n",
      "And what Putin is, in a sense, doing is this is sort of buyer’s remorse on the part of the Russians. They were weak in the mid-1990s — I mean, amazingly weak. The Russian economy had contracted by 50 percent between 1990 and 1996. That’s more than it had contracted during World War II. So Russia, at a moment of weakness, felt it gave up too much and is trying to, in a sense, claw back a piece of that, regardless of the fact that it violates international law, treaties that it’s signed, norms that have been established since 1945.\n",
      "Relatedly, it is a sort of last gasp of the last multinational empire in the world. If you think about it, this is not so uncommon in terms of buyer’s remorse, in terms of empires not wanting to let go of what they see as defining their core colonies that in a sense define who they are. The Ukrainians don’t want to be part of Russia’s empire. And if there’s one trend line you see over the last 100 years, it’s nationalism. It’s the power of people, once they have decided that they want to live free. That is an unstoppable force. And that is what Russia is against.\n",
      "I think the rest of it is honestly commentary in the sense that there will be day-to-day ups and downs, and the Russians will do well one month, and the Ukrainians will do well one month. But I think the secular trajectory is that Ukraine is going to be an independent nation.\n",
      "EZRA KLEIN: It felt to me — and tell me if you think this is wrong — that I was hearing more about possible shapes of end games, of resolutions, of settlements a year ago than I am now. There’s a strange sense in which people seem to have settled in to a long, protracted war of attrition. Do you think that’s right? Is that what you feel in the commentary?\n",
      "FAREED ZAKARIA: Yeah. I think you’re exactly right. And I think it’s probably for a few reasons. One is what we have realized is that neither side is strong enough to completely prevail, dominate, in this very quickly, yet neither side is so weak that they feel the need to capitulate. And that creates this dynamic where, as you say, it feels like this is going to be a long struggle.\n",
      "I think it’s also fair to say what we have been surprised by is the absolutely implacable nature of Ukrainian nationalism. That people have realized, look, the Ukrainians are not going to give up. They are not going to give up easily. They are not going to settle for something that doesn’t feel like they have essentially maintained their independence. They’ve surprised on the battlefield on the upside.\n",
      "So you put all that together, and I think you have a scenario where everyone is waiting for this Ukrainian counteroffensive. My guess is, as many people are saying, it will surprise on the upside as they have in the past. But I suspect it will not win the war. And that therefore, by the end of this year, you may begin to see a return to some of those conversations.\n",
      "But because the conflict has become so dark, the Russians have done things that are really extraordinary, bombing civilian facilities and water treatment plants and hospitals, it’s difficult to imagine how these two sides come to an agreement, a settlement, recognize each other. I think this ends more like the Korean War, which technically hasn’t ended. It just is the two sides stopped fighting. There is a demilitarized zone between the two armies, which is exactly why it’s called the DMZ. But there’s never a peace treaty signed.\n",
      "EZRA KLEIN: One dimension of the war that you hear, again, less about now than you did a year ago is the grip the Western sanctions have on the Russian economy. And early on, there was a sense that these were unexpectedly punishing. They began — the sense was they were maybe mild. Then very quickly, as Ukraine showed a ferocious level of resistance, they ramped up. Now, we were choking them off in the financial sector. There is certainly a sense that Russia is managing to limp along without the kind of punishing depression that would really put a lot of pressure on Putin.\n",
      "I have two questions on this, but the first is, why are the sanctions underperforming?\n",
      "FAREED ZAKARIA: It’s a great question. And there are two reasons I think. The first is we designed the sanctions so that Russia could continue to export energy. Russia could continue to sell oil and natural gas and also sells a lot of coal. And the reason is if Russian oil, natural gas and coal were completely shut out of the world markets, it would trigger a global recession. Oil would go to $200 a barrel, because all that Russian supply taken out of the market would mean that demand would vastly exceed supply. You would suddenly have huge price spikes. Much of the developed world would go into a recession, maybe even worse.\n",
      "So we designed the sanctions to sort of force the Russians to have to sell at a discount, bid less than they could make. So they’re getting a lot of revenue. Russia is a huge exporter of energy, perhaps the world’s largest depending on how you count it. So that’s one part of it, which is an inevitable reality about Russia’s role in the world economy and in the energy economy.\n",
      "The second — and I think this is the more unusual one — is there’s a big world economy out there now. We, I think, still have in our heads the idea that if the United States and Europe and Japan cut you off from the world economy, you’re done. But it turns out, about 50 percent of the world economy is now the so-called emerging markets. And they’re not abiding by the sanctions.\n",
      "So the reports I’m getting from Russia that, for example, Starbucks has left, as did a thousand Western companies. But if you go to Russia and you go to the corner store where Starbucks was, there’s a coffee shop there. It’s called Star Coffee. It’s owned by Russians; they sell coffee for about the same price. I don’t know if it says good or bad. But many of those abandoned Western businesses have been taken over by Turkish businesses, Chinese businesses, Russian-owned businesses. So there’s a whole rest of the world economy out there that is still playing with Russia.\n",
      "In fact, there’s some concern that the Russians are essentially evading the sanctions by importing things through Turkey, for example. The Turks buy something from the West. The Russians buy that same thing from Turkey. How do you prevent that?\n",
      "All that said, the piece that has been very effective is the freezing of the central bank reserves and the denial of technology. It is absolutely clear that Russia is crippled by the lack of access to Western technology at the very high end, particularly of the digital economy, high-end computer chips, for example. It is a remarkably narrow funnel. You’re basically getting the stuff from three or four companies that do chip design, one company that does chip manufacturing, A.S.M.L. in Holland. And all those are essentially in the West-plus. What I call the West-plus, meaning the West plus Japan, South Korea, Singapore.\n",
      "EZRA KLEIN: And so the hope, I think, in the West, at a certain point, was that these sanctions were going to be tight enough that Russia, if it couldn’t win quickly, it would not want to hold on slowly. Again, my sense is that’s not coming true. The sanctions are tough on them. They’re degrading their military, which is I think often an undernoticed important dimension of the sanctions. But the idea that they’re going to constrict enough to force Russia into settlement, because it can’t have this happen to them for three or four or five years, I don’t get the sense people are still optimistic about that.\n",
      "FAREED ZAKARIA: Yeah. I think that this is one of the biggest flaws in the way we conduct international affairs ever since the end of the Cold War, which is we want to do something. We eith...\n",

WP. (R) L. 112 minutes. ? ? ? \"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.\" — For five decades, celebrated author Judy Blume refused to sell the movie rights to her controversial novel, a frank account of a young girl struggling to understand an unfair world and her combined fear/excitement at the prospect of becoming a woman. Luckily for audiences, Blume let filmmaker Kelly Fremon Craig adapt her book into this appealing, gentle and well-acted movie starring the impressive Abby Ryder Fortson as Margaret and Rachel McAdams in a personal best performance as her mom. (PG-13) 105 minutes. ? ? ? 1/2 \"Chevalier\" — Joseph Bologne (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) was an extraordinarily accomplished man in Marie Antoinette's France. He was a scholar, a fencer, a virtuoso violinist and a sought-after composer. But he was all but erased from history because he was Black. This lush biopic, a fictionalized version of his story, brings him back to the forefront. AP. (PG-13) L, S, V. 107 minutes. ? ? ? \"Guy Ritchie's The Covenant\" — Guy Ritchie's affectingly emotional war film, set in Afghanistan at the end of the war, is quiet, introspective, contemplative. When an Afghan interpreter (Dar Salim) saves the life of Sgt. John Kinley (Jake Gyllenhaal) and helps him return home, Kinley runs into roadblocks trying to honor the covenant of getting the interpreter and his family out of the war-torn country. WP. (R) D, L, V. 123 minutes. ? ? ? \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" — Keanu Reeves returns as the laconic, titular hit man supreme, who, after breaching the rules of the High Table's secret society, metaphorically owes his soul to the company store, here operated by Marquis de Gramont (Bill Skarsgard). Wick's way out is to get to a sunrise duel in Paris, if he doesn't get picked off first. (R) L, V. 169 minutes. ? ? ? \"Polite Society\" — This irresistibly irreverent, boldly deranged, multi-pop-cultural take on British-Pakistani family values encompasses martial arts, horror, science fiction, romance, comedy, musicals and more horror. Sensing something isn't right, Ria (Priya Kansara) believes she must save her older sister Lena (Ritu Arya) from her impending wedding, which she attempts in great fashion. (PG-13) L, N, S, V. 103 minutes. ? ? ? 1/2 \"Somewhere in Queens\" — The impressive directorial debut of Ray Romano is set in the milieu of a working-class Italian American family in Queens headed by lovable sad sack Leo (Romano), whose pride and joy is his son (Jacob Ward), a talented high school basketball player who might have a chance for a college scholarship, until he starts dating a firecracker extrovert (Sadie Stanley). The screenplay is the true star here, smartly avoiding any arc of unearned redemption. With Laurie Metcalf, Sebastian Maniscalco. WP. (R) L, S. 106 minutes. ? ? ? Passables \"Beau Is Afraid\" — Anxiety-ridden Beau (Joaquin Phoenix) may be afraid, but writer-director Ari Aster certainly isn't. Rather than slotting in as a \"horror\" film, this violent movie can be categorized a little less neatly as a surreal three-hour Homeric odyssey about Jewish guilt, Oedipal angst and somebody named \"Birthday Boy Stab Man.\" With Amy Ryan, Nathan Lane, Patti LuPone, Parker Posey.

Jordan (reprising his role as retired heavyweight champion Adonis Creed) demonstrates great promise as a director with this ninth feature in the \"Rocky\" series, his feisty but flawed freshman effort behind the camera. This sequel packs moments of energetic sincerity, plus a stunning knockout performance by Jordan's formidable co-star and former bestie-turned-foe \"Dame\" Damian (Jonathan Majors).

The unobtrusively oily way his smarmy politician shoplifts his every scene buoys this generic, overpopped popcorn fantasy adventure featuring an obligatory parade of CGI monster battles in a riotous, out-of-control screenplay that refuses to play by its own broken rules. With Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez, Regé-Jean Page. (PG-13) L, V. 134 minutes. ? ? 1/2 \"Evil Dead Rise\" — Sorry \"Evil Dead\" fans: The fifth in the series is a disappointingly derivative gore fest. If \"Rise\" doesn't set a new standard of acceptance for grossly explicit violence in R-rated movies, it sure comes close. No one is safe when mom-of-three Ellie (Alyssa Sutherland) succumbs to the demonic Book of the Dead, especially not her pregnant sister (Lily Sullivan). (R) L, V. 97 minutes. ? ? \"How to Blow Up a Pipeline\" — Based on Swedish author Andreas Malm's 2021 book of the same name, this film centers on a group of activists who have been harmed by the fossil fuel industry and have reached the point where working within the system no longer suffices. As in all good heist flicks, there's misdirection, red herrings and cliffhangers, nearly all of which end with a genuine surprise. WP. (R) D, L. 104 minutes. ? ? 1/2 \"Renfield\" — The good news is that Nicolas Cage is perfect as Dracula. The bad news is that Cage's Prince of Darkness is only a supporting role here, making this film about Dracula's devoted henchman Renfield (Nicholas Hoult) trying to break free of his master's fearsome sway more of a tasty morsel than a satisfying feast. AP. (R) D, L, V. 93 minutes. ? ? 1/2 \"Scream VI\" — Despite the change of scenery to New York City, this is less a sequel and more a half-movie with some very satisfying stabbings but no real progress. The four main survivors from the fifth \"Scream\" are all here a year later (Melissa Barrera, Jenna Ortega, Mason Gooding, Jasmin Savoy Brown) and they're in the crosshairs of Ghostface yet again. Yawn. AP. (R) D, L, V. 123 minutes. ? ? 1/2 \"The Super Mario Bros.

Mario (Chris Pratt) has been separated from Luigi (Charlie Day) and he must help save Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) from being forced to wed Bowser. But in all its cartoony splendor, it's not anywhere near as fun as it would be to play it. AP.

      "Title: STAGE: 'PERICLES' OFFERED BY LAMOS AT HARTFORD\n",
      "Publisher: The New York Times\n",
      "Date: 1987-03-07\n",
      "Section: Section 1; Page 11, Column 5; Cultural Desk; review\n",
      "Length: 700 words words\n",
      "Body preview: The impressive design for Mark Lamos's production of ''Pericles'' at Hartford Stage is by John Conklin, by way of Rene Magritte. The stage surface is painted to resemble a cloud-filled sky. Floating in the air is a rocking chair - and soon the landscape is lined with Magritte men in tails and bowler hats.\n",
      "This late Shakespearean dream play has been turned into a surrealistic canvas of sudden reversals and transformations. In one of Mr. Lamos's many artful touches, various fathers, mothers and daughters are played by the same quick-changing actors. This family motif is carried out even in the brothel scene, where the pander and the bawd are made to seem like a working-class domestic couple.\n",
      "That bordello, in which Pericles's heroic daughter, Marina, is confined, is a clue to a concurrent theme of the production. While waiting for the start of the business night, the pander, the bawd and their henchman sit in a kitchen with a laundry line of black negligees in the background. The bordello itself is represented not by the customary haremlike trimmings but by a single, seedy mattress on the floor. Against this mundane background the conversation is, as always, definably decadent.\n",
      "In this and other scenes, Magritte has been replaced by a contemporary Neo-Expressionist such as Eric Fischl. As in Mr. Fischl's narrative paintings, the surface is as clear and as identifiable as a highway billboard, but in odd corners of the canvas bizarre and terrifying events are taking place.\n",
      "For the purposes of his production, the director has looked back to George Wilkins's Elizabethan novel, ''The Painful Adventures of Pericles, Prince of Tyre,'' which may or may not have been one of Shakespeare's sources. It is sometimes argued in the reverse, that Mr. Wilkins brought out his romance in 1608 to capitalize on the popularity of Shakespeare's play. In any case, the Hartford Stage version, which wears the Wilkins title, is an amalgam of Shakespeare, Wilkins and Mr. Lamos (as director and conceptualist). Because of the unfinished quality of the text, it is a play that lends itself to directorial elaboration.\n",
      "A few of Mr. Lamos's interpolations are ridiculous: Marina, for example, sings ''Amazing Grace'' to charm her father out of his depression. Fortunately, Jodi Long's performance as Marina overcomes that trite song selection, proving once again that, for all the play's disputed authorship, this moment is one of Shakespeare's most moving recognition scenes.\n",
      "Other Lamos additions range from the satiric (the incestuous Antiochus is dressed like an oil-rich sheik) to the striking (a broken sculptural head, perhaps of Diana, dominates the action like a deus ex machina). One of the more intriguing aspects of the production is the mixed ethnic casting, which is done in the most natural fashion and only once humorously calls attention to itself. In a moment of excitement, Lazaro Perez (who plays various villains) lapses into Spanish.\n",
      "Ms. Long is a noble Marina and there are, in addition, sharp-edged portraits by Darryl Croxton, Mario Arrambide, Angela Bassett, Amelia White and Mr. Perez. In contrast, Edward Zang, dressed like Old King Cole, delivers Gower's tale of Pericles with minimal vocal inflection. Though Jack Wetherall is sometimes mannered in the title role, he rises to the dramatic demands of his sea-tossed character.\n",
      "The production of ''Pericles'' is smaller in scale and not as unified in concept as Mr. Lamos's other excursions into Shakespeare (''Cymbeline,'' ''The Tempest''), but it does cast its own fanciful spell, drawing the audience into a dream of separation, reconciliation and renewal.\n",

      "Section: Section C; Page 23, Column 1; Cultural Desk; Review\n",
      "Length: 667 words words\n",
      "Body preview: ''THE Ragged Trousered Philanthropists'' represents the inelegant side of Edwardian England, where the working class - in this case a group of housepainters and decorators - struggles for a living in a society that has relegated it to the bottom of the ladder. The Robert Tressell novel first appeared in England in 1914, several years after the author had died, and it gradually became a classic of socialist literature. Among other things, the novel is credited with being instrumental in winning the election for the Labor Party in 1945.\n",
      "There is enough material in the book for a Masterpiece Theater series. In his adaptation, now running at Soho Rep, Stephen Lowe offers a stylized, thoughtful abridgement, as much a documentary as a drama. The play, which toured England in the late 1970's, was revived in 1983 at London's Half Moon Theater, where I first saw it on an unbearably hot July evening. In a sense, the audience's extreme discomfort added to the immediacy of the event, as we were led, brushstroke by brushstroke, through the depressed lives of these underpaid, underappreciated workers.\n",
      "In the course of the evening, the actors painted the inside of the theater - a new coat every performance -with a care and a diligence that would assure them of painting as an alternate profession. The Half Moon stood in for a house of the period.\n",
      "One would not have thought that this play, so rooted in a specific English environment and sensibility, would export easily. As it turns out, the Soho Rep has made an intrepid leap into the ''Ragged Trousered'' world, presenting the American premiere of Mr. Lowe's play and, to a great extent, simulating the English theatrical experience.\n",
      "Situated in a gymnasium on an upper floor of Greenwich House, Julian Webber's production stops short of repainting the entire place. The painting itself is somewhat cursory, but the performance is fueled with earthy regionalism and authenticity.\n",
      "With precision, the actors describe the close-knit community and the rising discontent of the workers, united in fear and in need. The painters are told that they work ''with their hands'' and the masters ''with their brains'' - and they believe it, despite evidence to the contrary. Under pressure from a militant socialist worker (Michael Wetmore), these skilled craftsmen begin to have glimmers of doubt about their roles as unwilling philanthropists for the upper classes.\n",
      "Though the conclusion is hortatory - the workers raise a banner of protest - the route is more personalized than polemical, as the playwright reveals character through detail and through a depiction of the work process itself. The men are not as individualized as characters in the works of David Storey. Nor does ''The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists'' claim the territory of theatrical metaphor. But it does draw a fine-lined group portrait of class disparity, of men forced by poverty and unemployment into consolidating their goals and their common interest.\n",
      "Mr. Webber has marshaled the American company into the equivalent of an English ensemble. The actors look and dress like men of the period, and they are also adept at singing folk songs, a feature of the briefly celebratory second act ''beano,'' or annual outing. The actors and the cast's one actress, Ellen Mareneck, double as both workers and bosses. Mr. Wetmore, Time Winters and Ms. Mareneck could be singled out for praise, but, in keeping with the provocative subject, the production is clearly a creative group effort.\n",

      "Body preview: Casting Lola Pashalinski and Crystal Field as the twins Sherrie and Cherrie Trifle, the first, ''the most famous lesbian of all time,'' the second, a working-class mother, is a clever idea. The two actresses could be sisters, but they have distinctive stage personalities. Miss Pashalinski is the Mae West of the Ridiculous and Miss Field is a billowy Bo Peep. However, in the case of the ladies' shared vehicle, Stephen Holt's ''The Blonde Leading the Blonde,'' at Theater for the New City, cleverness just about ends with the casting.\n",
      "Mel Gussow reviews Stephen Holt's play, \"The Blonde Leading the Blonde,\" at Theater for the New City\n",
      "The play is a door-slamming sex farce, three acts and three hours of high camp. The basic storyline - the twins switch roles for a day - allows the author to spoof everything from psychoanalysis to the not-for-profit theater. There is a devious slap at Robert Wilson in a skit titled ''Madame Curie on the Patio,'' and an amusing lunch at Schrafft's, where the sisters encounter the oldest, slowest waitress in the world. Later the waitress visits Sherrie's hotel (naturally, the Sherry Netherland) to deliver a very cold pizza. The comic rewards, however, are far too few for such a long sit.\n",
      "The cast, directed by John Albano, is a gallery of Off Off Broadway luminaries, including Helen Hanft in an unlikely cameo role as a writer of gossip who happens to work for The New York Times. She is trailed by her photographer, a bulb-popping ninny named Flash Kube, which should give you some idea of Mr. Holt's humor and of the out-of-date flavor of much of the evening.\n",
      "In addition to the two leads and Miss Hanft, there is creditable work from Lynn Oliver, Alex Mustelier and a dog named Ms. Jones, a veteran Theater of the New City scene-stealer, last seen in ''Farmyard.'' As usual, the dog enters, exits and wags on cue.  However, a few of the human performers appear to be graduates of the Tantrum School of Acting.\n",
      "Last season, Mr. Holt wrote three monologues for Miss Pashalinski, which demonstrated his writing talent and the actress's versatility.  This time, Mr. Holt's self-indulgence is unrestrained. He has cast himself as Miss Pashalinski's queenly secretary, a role that calls for him to put on a gown and a blond wig in order to impersonate his employer. This means that there are three Trifles on stage -or four, if you count the play.  Mel Gussow\n",

      "Section: Section C; Page 3, Column 1; Weekend Desk; Review\n",
      "Length: 1051 words words\n",
      "Body preview: Revolutionary Russia in 1907, Gorky's ''Enemies'' proved to be socially and politically prophetic, predicting the ascendancy of the working class. As a play, it is filled with humanity and richness of characterization. On its landscape are oppressed workers who are fighting for equity, oppressive managers and officials and the helpless who include, prominently, a paternalistic factory owner and his alcoholic brother. Along with ''The Lower Depths'' and ''Summerfolk,'' ''Enemies'' is one of the cornerstones of Gorky's theatrical reputation.\n",
      "In 1971 it was rediscovered by the Royal Shakespeare Company and it was presented the following year at Lincoln Center in a production directed by Ellis Rabb that remains an apex of artistry in the history of the Vivian Beaumont Theater. The Williamstown Theater Festival also offered its own production of the play several years later.\n",
      "BANNED in pre-Revolutionary Russia in 1907, Gorky's ''Enemies'' proved to be socially and politically prophetic, predicting the ascendancy of the working class.\n",
      "Williamstown's various Russian excursions during its 28 seasons, with Chekhov as well as Gorky, have at least two things in common.  They draw from a group of talented actors who make up a kind of informal floating repertory company, and they utilize a grove of apparently eternal birch trees. For the company's second attempt at ''Enemies,'' using a translation by Margaret Wettlin, the trees are once again atmospherically in place, and the samovar is steaming, but the actors, for the most part, are lost in a forest in search of a play.\n",
      "With its large cast and closely textured tapestry, ''Enemies'' demands an ensemble performance. It was rash of the director, Austin Pendleton, to attempt such an ambitious undertaking with a limited rehearsal period (followed by one week of performances, ending this weekend). But there is no excuse for the general ineptitude of his staging, especially when one considers the caliber of the actors in the company.\n",
      "In the pivotal role of an actress who is cognizant of the oncoming revolution but is unwilling to take a stand, Blythe Danner is erratic rather than mercurial. She is one of the loveliest actresses in the American theater (as demonstrated as Nina in Williamstown's ''Sea Gull,'' among many other roles), and it is sad to see her adrift.  She resorts to flourishes and flutterings in lieu of a characterization. The essence of Tatyana eludes her: a glamorous woman overcome by ennui, an actress unable to act in life.\n",
      "As her alcoholic, burnt-out case of a husband, Sam Waterston gives an inordinately mannered performance, loping around the stage at a tilt, trembling as he tipples. Katina Commings makes the factory owner's wife into a tedious and drab complainer. As the factory owner, George Morfogen fares better than his colleagues, but his character tends to fade into the background. Because all four, particularly Miss Danner, have given fine performances in the past, one must remonstrate the director for not exercising an overseeing eye.\n",
      "As a sign of Mr. Pendleton's evident policy of laissez faire, there is the performance of Dinah Manoff. As the factory owner's outspoken niece and spokesman for the playwright, she issues a passionate denunciation of the blindness of the upper classes. Miss Manoff conveys the girl's rebellious nature. With guidance, she might have been able to sustain her performance throughout the evening.\n",
      "On the other hand, in featured roles, three actors know exactly what they are doing, and they do it with confidence and persuasiveness: James Naughton as a coldly ambitious prosecutor; Joe Grifasi as an unqualified investigating officer; and, especially, Maria Tucci as an embittered wife coming to terms with the killing of her husband. These three irradiate Gorky's psychological perceptiveness and vivid theatricality. In minor roles, Emery Battis and Steve Lawson are effective.\n",
      "In the third, and best performed, act (following an enervating second act), Miss Tucci has a confrontation with Miss Danner, who rises to the occasion. One has only to watch Miss Tucci subtly express contradictory rays of admiration for, and animosity toward, Miss Danner's character to realize the complexity of the relationship. The outward compatability between the two women is circumstantial, a kind of detente. In common with so much else in this penetrating drama, beneath the surface are waves of turbulence and enmity.\n",

      "Body preview: Standing in the aisle of the Rosebud Theater, the woman at the microphone recently asked a brutally blunt question of Pat Choate, the Vice-Presidential half of Ross Perot's Reform Party ticket: With Mr. Perot's single-digit standing in the polls, how did the two of them plan, after the election, to champion their ideas of fiscal responsibility?\n",
      "Unfazed and with his professorial tongue firmly in his cheek, Dr. Choate responded, \"How would we go about that in the unlikely prospect we don't win?\" His one-liner set off gales of laughter among the several hundred students on hand for his speech at his alma mater, the University of Texas at Arlington, a Dallas suburb.\n",
      "Disarming his audiences with flashes of humor may be an indispensable weapon these days as the political economist and outspoken critic of the North American Free Trade Agreement and other trade accords goes about the lonely, uphill task of trying to persuade voters to listen to the party's message.\n",
      "The ticket's standing in the polls is no comfort. And if his Rosebud audience is typical, people seem attracted more out of curiosity than potential commitment. Unlike Vice President Al Gore and Jack Kemp, the Republican Vice-Presidential candidate, Dr. Choate does not have a traveling group of reporters watching his every move.\n",
      "But none of this has sapped his enthusiasm. In his speech here, Dr. Choate pushed the party agenda, including a call for tightening campaign finance laws.\n",
      "After telling the students that none of them had raised or could raise the more than $600,000 they would need to seek a House seat or the $4 million required for a Senate race, he told them: \"I come from this school. I come from a working-class background. Let me tell you, it's a simple miracle that I'm able to run for Vice President. It is only because it's a new party, a reform party and a billionaire helped create it.\"\n",
      "After the speech, a few students lingered to chat. And the Dallas-based ABC affiliate, Channel 8, devoted just a minute that night to Dr. Choate on the 5 o'clock newscast, nothing on the program at 6 and 45 seconds on the 10 o'clock news. The next day The Dallas Morning News carried an 18-line item on the talk.\n",
      "Dr. Choate spent the next morning in his North Dallas hotel suite. Just before 8:30 A.M. he telephoned his first campaign stop, CNN Radio in Kansas City, Mo. Two and a half hours and a muffin later, after four interviews, he had reached 21 states.\n",
      "From 11:30 A.M. to 12:30 P.M., at Perot '96 headquarters nearby, he tapped out answers on a computer keyboard to questions from high school students, using a CNN on-line chat service.\n",
      "While the policy planks in Dr. Choate's public remarks are the same as Mr. Perot, his sensibilities at times are not. Mr. Perot's speeches focus on helping the middle class; Dr. Choate often talks about aiding the working class.\n",
      "Answering the question at the Rosebud about the post-election fate of Reform Party ideas, Dr. Choate said that while he expected Mr. Perot to remain active in the party, he would return to the United Broadcasting Network, a radio network he says he controls along with a partner. But he said that the network would \"be very aggressive on these issues over the next four years.\"\n",
      "United Broadcasting produces public affairs programming and markets American-made products.\n",
      "Until his candidacy, Dr. Choate, who has a Ph.D. in economics, was a full-time policy analyst with his own research group, the Manufacturing Policy Project. In the early 1990's, he wrote \"Agents of Influence,\" in which he asserted that Japan's business interests were heavily involved in the affairs of the United States, and, if left unchecked, could turn this country into an economic colony.\n",
      "But in the campaign Dr. Choate has concentrated on other issues. In an interview, he said that contributions to the major parties by \"special interests\" had, in effect, erased the differences between the parties.\n",
      "President Clinton, a Southern Democrat, and Mr. Dole, the Republican nominee, are \"corporate Republicans,\" he said, adding: \"They're both financed by corporations. They seek the ratification and endorsement of those corporations.\"\n",
      "Between 2008 and 2012, he predicted, the nation will undergo a political realignment: The business-backed elements of the major parties will merge, and working-class, moderate and reform-minded voters will join the Reform Party, which will become a labor party, he said. \"What you're moving to in this country is back to a traditional alignment that we saw earlier in the century and that you see in England,\" he said. \"That's capital and labor. That's what is happening here -- a party of workers and the owner class.\"\n",

      "It was a theme that Mr. Torricelli repeated throughout the day, as he crisscrossed the state, shaking hands in northeastern New Jersey at a Teaneck restaurant that he has visited on the eve of Election Day throughout his political career, and dancing the hokey-pokey with preschoolers in Merchantville, a suburb of Philadelphia.\n",
      "A little later, Mr. Torricelli had an unexpected scare when a helicopter taking him from southern to central New Jersey was forced to make an emergency landing because of a mechanical problem.\n",
      "The helicopter landed in a field in Robbinsville in Mercer County and no one was hurt, but the candidate had to cancel an appearance at Brookdale Community College in Lincroft. Later, as he shook hands with commuters at the Hoboken train station, Mr. Torricelli said he did not have time to be frightened. \"It happened pretty fast,\" he said.\n",
      "With public opinion polls showing the race a virtual dead heat, Mr. Torricelli, a 14-year veteran of the House who has won seven straight elections, was concerned and cautiously optimistic.\n",
      "In Teaneck, a Democratic stronghold in the Ninth Congressional District, which Mr. Torricelli represents, he walked along the main business district on Cedar Lane and shook hands inside Louie's Charcoal Pit -- a personal ritual before Election Day. \"A little superstition\" brought him there, he confessed.\n",
      "Inside Noah's Ark, a local deli, Mr. Torricelli told workers, \"I think we'll be O.K.\" Before departing for South Jersey, he hugged a longtime Democratic friend, Assemblywoman Loretta Weinberg, and assured her, \"We'll be all right.\"\n",
      "In a separate interview, Mr. Torricelli said his private pollsters had predicted a victory. \"Our pollsters have told us it will be close, but we should win by a few points,\" he said.\n",
      "Determined to push Mr. Zimmer outside the middle ground -- where a majority of New Jersey's voters traditionally dwell -- Mr. Torricelli criticized one of his opponent's recent advertisements because he said it reflected a narrow interest.\n",
      "\"Dick Zimmer has an advertisement where he's feeding the sheep and pitching hay,\" Mr. Torricelli told the group in Perth Amboy. \"Well, I don't know sheep. But I know Jersey City. I know Newark. I know Perth Amboy, and I know the major suburban communities of north New Jersey. That's the difference here.\"\n",
      "Throughout the day, the Democratic candidate recited the list of his endorsements from news organizations and interest groups. And although Mr. Torricelli has received more endorsements from larger organizations, at times his hyperbole wrongly suggested that Mr. Zimmer had received none at all.\n",
      "\"The fact that Dick Zimmer is isolated and campaigning by himself without any of the major newspapers in the state of New Jersey, any of these environmental organizations, without any of these senior citizen organizations, I think is an indication that this is a question of the mainstream against the extreme,\" Mr. Torricelli said.\n",
      "With his schedule planned to attract as much free television coverage as possible, Mr. Torricelli flew from Teaneck to Merchantville in Camden County, where Philadelphia television stations filled a church day care center to watch him dance with small children and join them for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Voters in South Jersey get their network television from Philadelphia stations.\n",
      "With the decision just hours away, Mr. Torricelli urged supporters in Perth Amboy, \"Knock on doors, pick up phones, and bring people to vote.\" And then he made one final promise: \"As the years go by and you remember you were part of this campaign, I'll make you proud.\"\n",

      " To listen to both his defenders and critics, Donald Trump represents the U.S. version of a new nationalism popping up around the world. I'm not so sure.\n",
      " In a fairly representative analysis, Politico's Michael Hirsh explained the \"new nationalism\" as \"a bitter populist rejection of the status quo that global elites have imposed on the international system since the Cold War ended, and which lower-income voters have decided - understandably - is unfair.\"\n",
      " James P. Pinkerton, writing for the stridently pro-Trump website Breitbart.com, sees nothing less than a \"Worldwide Trumpian Majority\" forming to oppose globalization in all its forms.\n",
      " Interestingly, commentators across the ideological spectrum also agree that these trends are fueled by economic conditions - manifested here as outrage at Wall Street and global trade deals - and can be solved by some government response. Both Trump and Hillary Clinton offer similar solutions, such as more trade barriers and massive infrastructure spending.\n",
      " That interpretation is fine as far as it goes, but I don't think it goes very far. Ultimately, the term nationalism distorts more than it clarifies about what's going on with Trump supporters in the United States.\n",
      " First, suggestions that a Trumpian nationalism is rising among all low-income Americans could only be true if all low-income Americans were white. Reading Breitbart.com's celebrations of populist nationalism or the constant invocations of \"We the People\" from Trump supporters on social media might leave you with that impression. This is not to say that everyone who supports Trump is a \"white nationalist\" - which conjures various racist doctrines. Rather, it is to simply point out that Trump's support is overwhelmingly, almost exclusively, white.\n",
      " Clinton, according to some polls, gets nearly 9 out of 10 Latino voters and 9.9 out of 10 African American voters. When Trump pointed out a black attendee at one of his rallies and said, \"That's my African American,\" he might have been speaking literally.\n",
      " I think commentators focus on the broad-stroke economic arguments because the real issues - the American cultural ones - are so fraught. Simply put, this so-called nationalism in the United States is really little more than a brand name for generic white identity politics.\n",
      " Liberals are uncomfortable discussing this; to do so would acknowledge how they failed the white working-class voters who were once the emotional heart of the Democratic Party but are now the core of Trump's support. The Democrats' emotional heart now revolves around a diversity-mania that left many of its traditional voters feeling deserted - or as President Obama once put it, bitterly clinging to their guns and their Bibles.\n",
      " The Trumpian nationalist right wants to stay focused on economics, because to be open about their cultural appeal would be to admit that they have surrendered to the logic of left-wing identity politics.\n",
      " Imagine for a moment you are a member of the working white poor in the parts of America that J.D. Vance writes about in his best-selling Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis. Imagine how ridiculous phrases like \"white (male) privilege\" sound to you. Imagine you are an evangelical Christian, repeatedly told by elites and authority figures that your faith is the source of un-American injustices - but that to suggest Islamic terrorism might have some relationship to Islam is rank bigotry.\n",
      " Every year, liberal pundits metaphorically rub their hands in glee at the latest demographic projections forecasting the dissolution of the white majority in the United States. Is it so shocking that some white people might not greet that prospect with the same glee - particularly when they have not seen tangible benefits from the immigration that is the source of all that diversity?\n",
      " Daily, I receive emails and comments from people who describe themselves as nationalists - but who are, in fact, making arguments for white culture as if whites were now an oppressed minority in need of an American government that zealously defends their interests. Right or wrong, many of them believe that Trump will protect white culture from the forces of multiculturalism, and Christianity from spreading secularism.\n",
      " Which brings me back to why I think nationalism is a poor word to describe what we're witnessing in this election.\n",
      " If nationalism is supposed to do anything, it's supposed to unify the country. When I look at these so-called nationalists, though, I don't see a unifying force. I see the latest entrants into a decades-old game of subdividing the country into tribes seeking to yoke government to their narrow agendas.\n",

      "Body preview: By David Schultz\n",
      " It's not simply a handful of swing states that will decide the 2016 presidential election. The swing voters in the swing counties of the swing states will decide it. And if my calculations are correct, it is perhaps no more than 19 counties in 11 states - less than 500,000 voters - who truly matter. That's why Scranton seems to be so important this year.\n",
      " From 1988 to 2012 the balance of power in U.S. presidential races has centered on 10 states. Republicans were likely to win 23 states, totaling 191 electoral votes, and the Democrats 18 states and the District of Columbia, with 232 electoral votes. There are 10 swing states - Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, and Wisconsin - with a total of 115 electoral votes. These are the states where the presidential candidates campaign and visit after the conventions. They are the bellwether states, the battleground states. These states are the most likely to flip from one party to another, and the margin of election victory in each is generally close. Some, such as Florida and Ohio, are even more decisive than others in terms of their presidential selection influence.\n",
      " These are still the crucial swing states in the 2016 election. Donald Trump's candidacy, both its strengths in appealing to white working-class voters, which may open up Pennsylvania as a swing state, or its weaknesses, such as its racial overtures that might make Utah and Georgia possible Democrat pickups, might change the electoral map slightly. But the Electoral College and the way states allocate their electoral votes, along with the rise of political polarization and the declining number of swing voters to perhaps 5 percent of the electorate, mean that, even this year, in approximately 40 states, the presidential race is largely already over.\n",
      " But while pundits write about the swing states, more fascinating is how within them there are only a handful of counties that are decisive. They are the swing counties where the candidates actually campaign and where, if they can win them, they win the state. Since 1988 there have been a handful of swing counties. In Colorado it is Jefferson County that is key to winning that state. For New Hampshire, it is Hillsborough County, North Carolina has Wake County, and Virginia's is Prince William. In Florida it is Hillsborough, and in Ohio it is Hamilton. Win Hamilton you win Ohio; win Ohio you win the presidency.\n",
      " In 2012 there were 15 counties in the 10 swing states that were critical to President Obama's reelection victory. There were about 3.88 million votes cast and Obama won 53.2 percent. He out-polled Mitt Romney by less than 350,000 votes. It is not clear whether Romney could have persuaded those voters to switch to him or whether he needed to mobilize others. The reality, however, is that across those 15 counties in 10 states, a switch of about 350,000 or so votes would now have Romney running for his second term in 2016.\n",
      " Assume these are the same swing counties and states this year, and that the number of swing voters there is up to 500,000 with population growths. Now add Pennsylvania, a state that has voted solidly for the Democratic presidential candidate since 1988. Trump needs to flip it to win.\n",
      " There are four counties - Bucks, Chester, Luzerne, and Lackawanna - that may be key to winning the Keystone State. Lackawanna - where Scranton is located - seems to be the center of Pennsylvania's political universe this year. Both Trump and Clinton have made recent visits there; expect more by November.\n",
      " In 2012 almost 97,000 voted in Lackawanna County, with Obama winning nearly 63 percent. Flipping that county seems like a tall order. Yet these four counties had a total of 790,000 voters in 2012, and Obama won them with less than 52 percent - about a 26,000-vote spread. Conceivably, Trump could flip them. But, given that Obama won the commonwealth by more than 300,000 votes in 2012, Pennsylvania is a long shot.\n",
      " Including Pennsylvania, there are only about 19 swing counties in this year's presidential contest that seem to matter, and the number of swing voters there may be less than 500,000. The key is moving these few swing voters in these swing states. The rest of us should vote, but the reality is that the next president will be selected by a few voters in a few counties.\n",

      "Body preview: Simple red-and-white signs around town only hint at the heat of Gloucester City's struggle over the looming layoffs of 15 municipal employees, including eight in the Fire Department.\n",
      "The \"We Support our Gloucester City Firefighters\" placards look downright decorous compared to some of the more explosive emotions at a standing-room-only City Council meeting May 27.\n",
      "But in Gloucester as elsewhere these days, political battles are fought not only via packed rooms, lawn signs, and letters to the editor, but also on websites, blogs, Facebook pages, and YouTube videos. And matters can get every bit as personal in cyberspace.\n",
      "The full-time, paid Fire Department is characterized as \"a bunch of seventh-grade girls,\" and critics are accused of a willingness to risk lives. Online posts claiming to possess \"real\" facts alternately depict firefighters as swashbuckling heroes or overpaid desk jockeys.\n",
      "\"They put my home address and phone number online and told people to come and knock on my door,\" says Bill Cleary, whose \"Cleary's Note Book\" blog closely covers this Delaware River city of 11,500.\n",
      "A Facebook page recently targeted Cleary, the publisher emeritus of the city's weekly paper, and called for the shutdown of his blog for \"demonizing\" firefighters. He had questioned department spending, as well as the provenance of an official-looking \"just the facts\" website that's cheerleading for the department.\n",
      "Given the $1.3 million municipal budget gap and the state's fiscal crisis, no questions ought to be off the table - even in a community where the memories of a brutal blaze eight years ago haven't faded, particularly among what's often called a brotherhood of firefighters.\n",
      "The July 4, 2002, inferno in a house on North Broadway killed three young sisters and three firefighters. They are memorialized at the department's King Street headquarters, where a handsome sculpture garden expresses not only the grief of the entire community, but also the solidarity among the families, friends, and supporters of generations of firefighters from across the region.\n",
      "The memorial means something.\n",
      "But so do the city's budget numbers.\n",
      "\"The money's not there,\" says Jack Lipsett, city administrator. \"The heady days of the '90s and early 2000s are done.\"\n",
      "In the center of town, Mike Hall and his wife, Barbara, own Duffy's Delicious Candies Inc.\n",
      "\"I really don't want to see any layoffs,\" says Mike, a retired Camden police officer. \"You don't want fire coverage to suffer. A matter of seconds can mean lives.\n",
      "\"On the other hand, I can see it from the side of a taxpayer,\" he adds. \"I believe there have to be some sort of caps on spending. It's got to be reasonable.\"\n",
      "Gloucester firefighters are working under a 2008 contract that provides a starting salary of $39,920. Not bad for someone who may not have a college degree, but does have a desire to serve the public.\n",
      "So, for this working-class town to even consider laying off firefighters, as Collingswood has done and Passaic and Irvington may do, suggests the gravity of the situation, locally and statewide.\n",
      "After all, not for nothing has New Jersey become America's unofficial Capital of Taxation.\n",
      "\"We're sorry for all the people who are hurting,\" says Robert Brower, vice president of the Firemen's Benevolent Association (FMBA). The union has 118 locals and 5,500 members statewide, including Gloucester.\n",
      "\"We've made concessions,\" he says. \"Administration [jobs] have been cut to the max in fire departments. We need to work together to come up with solutions.\"\n",
      "City officials and union representatives will resume talks Friday.\n",
      "Lipsett says Gloucester has made proposals regarding sick time and vacation pay that could yield savings and save jobs. Jeff Sanderson, president of FMBA Local 251, says the union is willing to listen.\n",
      "\"We don't want these layoffs,\" he says. \"We're going to do everything we can.\"\n",

      "But your chances of hearing more about it just got bigger. \n",
      "A major exhibition space and new studios for 10 artists opened last month at 1001 White Horse Pike in the \"South of Haddon Arts and Business District,\" the promotional name for a section of Haddon Township most folks call Oaklyn. \n",
      "A potters' collective, a sculptor, and a mixed-media artist already occupy the rear of the landmark building, where a sleek street-level hair salon offers its own brand of artistry. \n",
      "\"This is the new gallery space,\" says Christine Hopkins, who owns the salon and formerly headed the township's business-improvement district. She's also partners with building owner Dom Flamini in the expanded arts venture, which easily doubles exhibition and studio space for artists in the neighborhood. \n",
      "I'm standing in what, less than two months ago, was a humdrum second-floor warren of offices, now a stylish aerie with 12-foot ceilings; shiny pine floors; and big, bold paintings by local artists on all-white walls. \n",
      "\"This is my baby,\" says Flamini, who bought the building - once home to a sporting-goods store known for its batting cages - in 1985. He leased space to a number of retail and office tenants; the first artists arrived in 2002. \n",
      "Maria Christopher is the first to occupy one of the new studios. \n",
      "\"This building is really positive and bright,\" says the painter, whose former studio was near Philadelphia's Italian Market. \"It has great energy.\" \n",
      "\"When space is very expansive, you feel things in a more expansive way,\" says sculptor Ted Warchal, who moved his studio from Merchantville to 1001 four years ago. \"I think the new [studios] are really wonderful. . . . They will help create a sense of community in the building.\" \n",
      "The working-class stretch of the pike where Haddon Township, Oaklyn, and Collingswood blur into one another lacks the coolness factor of Philly's edgier, art-centric neighborhoods. I know; I lived on the 1100 block of the pike for 26 years. \n",
      "But this old-fashioned commercial strip has a bit of urban grit and a surprisingly diverse residential and business blend - soul food, lingerie, new-age books, tuxedos, and tattoos are all available within a few blocks of one another. And if you still need some Philly edge, NJ Transit buses can get you into Center City in 20 minutes. \n",
      "\"I love the unpretentiousness,\" says Fran Gallun, a mixed-media artist, who moved into Flamini's building in 2002. \n",
      "The down-to-earth quality also attracted Jocelynn Tice, a portraitist and teacher who owns My Studio. \n",
      "That's down-to-earth, as in, low rent, for the storefront where she opened her business in 2002. \n",
      "\"Some people come in and say, 'What the hell are you doing here?' \" Tice laughs. \"I tell them, 'Making money.' \" \n",
      "One way she does this is by painting props and other items for the Ritz Theatre, which transformed a former White Horse Pike porn palace into a legitimate stage venue 26 years ago. \n",
      "Adding more artists to the neighborhood can only help, says producing artistic director Bruce Curless, whose organization was first to put the district on the cultural map. \n",
      "More recently, across from the Ritz, musician and teacher Sara O'Brien launched her eclectic and lively Studio LuLoo performance space on the Oaklyn side of the pike. \n",
      "Located in a house that served for decades as a dry-cleaning shop, the studio offers open-mike nights as well as concerts by local bands. It will soon move to nearby West Clinton Avenue, and a gallery will take over the space on the pike. \n",
      "Despite such positive signs, the neighborhood still misses the Newton Diner, which burned to the ground last year and remains an empty lot. Vacant storefronts dot both sides of the strip as well. \n",
      "\"People here are really dedicated,\" O'Brien says. \"They really care about the arts and the community. But it's tough. It's going to take time.\" \n",
      "Flamini, of Moorestown, says he's in it for the long haul. \n",
      "\"I used to be a teacher,\" he explains. Owning a building full of artists offers a chance for a landlord \"to be creative.\" \n",

      "Body preview: The next president will inherit a wide range of economic problems, from soaring food and gas prices, to a slumping housing industry, to a weak job market and the tumbling value of the dollar. \n",
      "Candidates John McCain and Barack Obama offer very different plans to improve the faltering economy. Their respective proposals are rooted in traditionally conservative and liberal solutions. \n",
      "At a town-hall meeting in Philadelphia on Wednesday, Republican McCain prescribed economic medicine of tax cuts for virtually anyone and anything that is taxed. He would cut the corporate tax rate gradually from 35 to 25 percent, arguing that it will provide incentives for businesses to create more jobs. \n",
      "He would extend the Bush tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of 2010, for individuals at all income levels. He'd lower the tax rate on estates and exempt all estates worth less than $10 million, up from the current $1 million. \n",
      "In an era of relentless government red ink, McCain's plan promises to create even bigger federal deficits. That will put pressure on interest rates to rise, making it more expensive to finance the purchase of homes and cars, and hinder job creation. McCain's proposals to make permanent the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 would drain $4.4 trillion from the federal treasury over the next decade, just as the government faces increasing demands to pay the bills under Medicare and Social Security for retiring baby boomers. \n",
      "It's an equation that's not consistent with McCain's advocacy of balanced budgets. McCain says he will cut government spending to help balance the books, but he hasn't said how. Perhaps his advisers are still working on massive cuts to programs, which would need to total nearly $500 billion per year. \n",
      "Democrat Obama proposes tax cuts, too, but his plan is targeted toward an individual's ability to pay. He would raise taxes on households with income of more than $250,000. He would extend the Bush income-tax cuts for middle-class wage earners, and eliminate federal income taxes for seniors earning less than $50,000. He would raise the capital gains tax to as high as 28 percent, from the current 15 percent. Obama would raise taxes on those who have reaped the greatest benefit from tax cuts in the past eight years. \n",
      "As far as grappling with deficits, Obama's tax plan is more realistic than McCain's, but only slightly. The Democrat would spend most of the increased tax revenue on other priorities such as government-funded health insurance and a package of middle-class rebates to help stimulate the economy. \n",
      "McCain's claim that Obama's plan would raise taxes on \"Americans of every background\" is a distortion. Of the middle-class and working-class families who have investments, most invest in 401(k) retirement accounts, which are exempt from capital gains. And Obama's proposal would eliminate taxes for about 10 million low-income households. \n",
      "Obama would give $20 billion in aid to prevent mortgage foreclosures. His overall plan is more aggressive and more costly; McCain, who opposed such federal aid until recently, would provide up to $10 billion for federally insured mortgages. \n",
      "The roughly $10 billion-a-month cost of the war in Iraq also affects the government's ability to pay for domestic priorities. Those financial pressures are likely to continue longer under a President McCain, whose commitment to the military occupation is open-ended. \n",
      "Neither candidate offers much hope of controlling massive federal deficits anytime soon, or the soaring gas and food prices. But Obama's proposed economic policies would be fairer to families who have been falling further behind during the past eight years....\n",

      "Body preview: Sarah Palin forgot to mention there is one other difference between one hockey mom and a pitbull: a new $150,000 wardrobe.\n",
      " Right after Palin was plucked from obscurity and thrust onto the national stage as John McCain's running mate, the Republican National Committee spent $150,000 on clothes, makeup and hairstyling for Alaska's governor.\n",
      " Overnight, the moose hunter became a clothes horse.\n",
      " The tab for Palin's makeover included $75,062 spent at Neiman Marcus; $49,425 at Saks Fifth Avenue; and $5,102 at Bloomindales. The shopping spree also included stops at Barney's New York and high-end children's and men's shops, suggesting Palin's new baby and her husband - or \"the First Dude,\" as she calls him - benefited as well.\n",
      " McCain spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt downplayed the attention on Palin's new threads. \"With all of the important issues facing the country right now, it's remarkable that we're spending time talking about pantsuits and blouses,\" Schmitt said. \n",
      " Given two wars, the global financial crisis, and a looming recession, Schmitt is right. But here's the rub: McCain and Palin have devoted much of the fall campaign raising one inane issue after another, from lipstick on a pig to Joe the plumber.\n",
      " At the same time, Palin has presented herself as the folksy hockey mom in touch with average Americans. She often talks about \"Joe Six-Pack.\" Wink.\n",
      " The problem is that most hockey moms are struggling to buy back-to-school shoes for their kids and don't have personal shoppers outfitting them with $150,000 in new clothes for the fall season.\n",
      " It's understandable that Palin would need some new power suits for the Republican Convention and campaign trail. But $150,000 worth? And the governor isn't exactly destitute. Why were the clothes purchased by RNC campaign donors?\n",
      " Similar criticisms can be leveled at Joe Biden, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, who portrays himself as the working-class kid from Scranton who now takes the train home from Washington every night. \n",
      " However, Biden's 7,000-square-foot home in Wilmington sits on four acres overlooking a pond and is estimated to be worth $3 million. Not bad for a career politician who gets paid $169,300 a year.\n",
      " Something is wrong with the political system when so-called public servants are living lifestyles of the rich and famous. Real hockey moms aren't carrying snacks for the team in a Hermes handbag....\n",

      "Body preview: The language of political campaigning sparkles with coinages, clangs with old and new symbols and fills the hall with updated echoes of past political struggles. Here's a selection of '08-isms.\n",
      "  Symbol of the little guy: John Q. Public    made his debut as the baseball fan rooting for the 1922 New York Giants. For    Franklin Delano Roosevelt, it was the economist William Graham Sumner's    the forgotten man, sighted by the new    president ''at the bottom of the economic pyramid.'' At the 1956 Republican    convention, a dump-Nixon rump movement nominated the nonexistent Joe    Smith; he was later replaced by Joe Six-Pack    as cultural hero of those in 1864 who hailed the    great unwashed and in 1969 emerged victorious as the    silent majority.\n",
      "  This year, Gov. Sarah Palin modernized the soccer mom    with the hockey mom and the Wal-Mart    mom. (That chain has a great euphemism for the guy on the way out who makes    sure you're not stealing stuff: the exit    greeter.) John McCain brought the unforgotten everyman up to date in the third presidential debate as Joe the Plumber.    Suddenly, plumber -- a word associated    with nefarious leak plugging in the Watergate era -- emerged as the ringing    sobriquet of Samuel J. Wurzelbacher of Holland, Ohio.    This big, bald, salt-of-the-earth fellow, worried about taxes, elicited a damaging    answer from a canvassing Barack Obama that concluded, ''when you spread the wealth around, it's    good for everybody.''\n",
      "  Spreading, or sharing, the wealth -- as against creating the wealth -- was promptly pounced upon and roundly denounced by McCain-Palin conservatives. That was because the phrase has long been used to describe the discredited socialist scheme of income redistribution popularized during the Great Depression: the 1934 Share-Our-Wealth Society was the political organization headed by the Louisiana senator Huey Long, a too-aggressive Progressive. Its slogan was ''Every Man a King,'' taken from a speech by William Jennings Bryan, the perennial Democratic presidential candidate around a century ago.  \n",
      "  The spread-the-wealth remark enabled McCain to charge, ''Senator Obama's plans are class warfare,'' a charge effectively leveled at Democrats in 2004. Its origin is in the Marx-Engels ''Communist Manifesto,'' as the German Klassenkampf, more accurately translated as ''class struggle.''  \n",
      "  Weeks before his evocation of Joe the Plumber, McCain came under fire for his statement seeking to calm the early-October financial panic: ''the fundamentals of our economy are strong.'' That brought the derisive Obama riposte: ''What economy are you talkin' about?'' (The letter g has been stricken from the political alphabet.) Justin Fox of Time magazine said the McCain phraseology, reminiscent of Herbert Hoover's attempt at reassurance, ''may go down as one of the great blunders of presidential campaign history.'' Fox noted, however, that the United States work force and American ingenuity were surely fundamentals, ''and it's not at all crazy to argue that these fundamentals are strong.'' (Updated political adage: ''It ain't what you say, or even the way that you say it -- but it's who said it that way before.'')  \n",
      "  The derogation of derogation is doing well. Beanbag, a children's game whose object is easy to catch, made a comeback this year. Mudslinging, as a term, is passe; time was, Adlai Stevenson could coin a Confucianist epigram, ''He who slings mud generally loses ground,'' but mud has lost its dirtiness in the vocabulary of dirty tricks. ''It's Sliming Time (Again)'' was a headline in The Nation last month; Eric Alterman, its liberal media columnist, began a paragraph with ''Sure, politics ain't beanbag, but . . . '' The but almost always follows the bag; McCain recently said of politicking: ''It's not an easy business. It's not beanbag. But it is exhilarating. It's exciting.'' Obama, in the spring primaries, added a local touch: ''Politics ain't beanbag; that's what they say in Chicago.'' The aphorism was indeed created in that city, first used in The Chicago Evening Post in 1895 by Finley Peter Dunne, repeated a few years later by Dunne's creation, ''Mr. Dooley,'' in his Irish brogue: ''Politics ain't beanbag. 'Tis a man's game; an' women, childher, an' pro-hybitionists 'd do well to keep out iv it.''  \n",
      "  Boneheaded emerged as a favored self-deprecating Obama-ism. He used it first to describe his dealings with the Chicago real estate developer and fixer Tony Rezko and returned to the word last month to characterize a remark he made to San Francisco fund-raisers regarding small-town Pennsylvanians who ''cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them.'' Obama told Matt Bai in The Times Magazine that it ''was my biggest boneheaded move.'' As an endearing Americanism associated with a baseball blunder, the word is not as severe as ''foolish'' and less insensitive than ''dumb.''\n",
      "  Heartbeat from the presidency got a good run this year in the sustained belittlement of Governor Palin as potential vice president. Its origin, though without the metaphoric heartbeat, came from Mark Hanna, in 1900 the manager of the Republican William McKinley's presidential campaign, regarding the selection of Theodore Roosevelt as running mate: ''Don't any of you realize that there's only one life between this madman and the White House?'' \n",
      "  The Bradley Effect -- a possible misleading of pollsters by voters explored in this space in September -- was a phrase that received much thumb sucking among the punditariat during October and will either enter or permanently depart the political language this week.\n",
      "  Close the deal keeps popping up, more than in previous campaigns, mainly directed at Obama. Just before the April Pennsylvania Democratic primary, Senator Hillary Clinton asked, ''Why can't he close the deal, with his extraordinary financial advantage?'' (After she won that primary, Obama said, ''The way we're going to close the deal is by winning,'' as he subsequently showed in achieving the nomination.) But that vogue phrase, rooted in business lingo, lasted through October: ''The Speech That Could Close the Deal'' was the Washington Post headline over a column by David Ignatius, and The Times Magazine headlined an article about the working-class vote ''Can Obama Close the Deal With Those White Guys?'' In the cliche derby, the doubting close the deal is running neck and neck with the affirmative the race is Obama's to lose as we approach the finish line.  \n",

      "Body preview: Warsaw is full of white people. Obviously, that statement applies to the capital of Poland, but the Warsaw I'm referring to is a club in Brooklyn. It's a Thursday night, and I'm standing alongside 800 Caucasian hipsters in a Greenpoint rock venue, waiting to see the Streets. The Streets is technically a group, but it's really a group of one: Mike Skinner, a 24-year-old from Britain who looks as if he's 15. Do not feel depressed if you've never heard of him; he is not famous. Except that he is, if you happen to be the kind of person who searches for potential pop geniuses. In certain circles, in certain clubs and pretty much anywhere in London, Skinner is one of those \"voice of a generation\" types; as the writer-rapper-producer for the Streets, he has experienced the kind of meteoric ascension (at least among critics) that changes a messenger into his own self-styled medium. \n",
      "     His debut record, \"Original Pirate Material,\" sold slightly more than 100,000 copies in the United States, but it has been dubbed the first transcendent hip-hop album ever to emerge from England -- which is kind of like being dubbed the sexiest female at a hobbit convention. But Skinner, whose new mini-album, \"All Got Our Runnins,\" went on sale online this week, represents a British youth movement everyone else has ignored. The Streets' lyrics speak of the geezer lifestyle -- the mundane, day-to-day pursuits of antitrendy, blue-collar males in England's lower middle class. As he wanders around the stage, Skinner talks about watching television and taking bong hits. He's telling us that we need to \"push things forward\" and that \"geezers need excitement,\" and I barely understand what he means. But I know it feels authentic, somehow. Now the dude is talking about his skill at PlayStation and his affinity for fish and chips. Skinner's reality is like Jerry Seinfeld's: it's about nothing. But for most people (and certainly for most of those inside Warsaw), this is what reality is. \n",
      " \"Not a lot of people rap about playing Nintendo, but everybody I know plays Nintendo,\" Skinner says. \"That was sort of the point of my record: I'm like everybody else, or at least like everyone else I know. I'm not crazy, and none of the people I know are crazy. It's just that I can talk about Nintendo and drugs and watching the telly because I won't get fired for doing so. That's why people buy into my music, I think. What I talk about is what real people do.\"\n",
      "Six weeks before seeing him perform in Brooklyn, I interviewed Skinner in London. We sat in a 12-by-12-foot room at a management company called Coalition that contained almost nothing: a table, two chairs, a pitcher of water and a tape recorder. It seemed better suited for interrogating potential Al Qaeda operatives. Skinner kept looking at me like a beagle puppy: huge brown eyes, big ears, paws that seem too big for his body and a general sense of optimism. \n",
      "\"Everything I rap about is really just an example of me talking about myself,\" he says. \"I mean, I could talk about this tape recorder, but I'd really just be talking about my perception of what it is. I've never been interested in the idea of someone being able to get anything they want out of a song. My sister, she thinks that you should be able to find your own meanings in songs. She likes Radiohead. I'm not like that. All that 'I'm just a fish in the sea, I'm so lonely' -- that's kind of rubbish. There is nothing on my record that you can't understand literally.\"\n",
      "After 90 minutes in the interrogation room, I persuade Skinner to go to a pub. As we leave, we pass a desk with dozens of photocopies of a Rolling Stone article about the Streets calling him \"England's Eminem.\" I ask him what he thinks of that comparison.\n",
      "\"Oh, I suppose it's because we're both white and we both tell stories,\" he says. \"I'm not as angry as he is, although I don't think he's as angry as he is, either. I quite liked \"8 Mile,\" though. It was sort of like \"The Karate Kid,\" you know? Have you seen \"The Karate Kid\"? Very similar kind of thing.\"\n",
      "In truth, the connection between Eminem and the Streets is almost nonexistent; if not for a shared lack of pigment, they'd never be mentioned in the same sentence. And unlike Eminem, Skinner never refers to his whiteness in his songs; he more often addresses the anachronistic British class system. \"The really posh people in England are the only ones who still care about class,\" he says. \"Nobody our age thinks like that anymore.\"\n",
      "Because so much of his material appears to come from the perspective of a lower-middle-class ruffian, Skinner has been portrayed as a representative of the working class, a backstreets kid from Birmingham. But Skinner, who now lives in London, resists the working-class designation and insists his life has been relatively easy. Still, his persona as a cultural intruder is not a total fabrication. \n",
      "\"What I hate about London is that there are so many loafers claiming to be artists,\" he says at the pub. \"I was raised on function. If you have a job in Birmingham, you're a waitress. You sell insurance. You build something people can use.\" Or you buy a PlayStation and become a rapper. \n",

      "Hacksaw Ridge One of Mel Gibson's greatest achievements as director, this incredibly violent, gory WWII epic tells the true story of U.S. Army medic Desmond Doss (a remarkable Andrew Garfield), who became one of the most decorated soldiers of the Pacific Theater without firing a single shot. A conscientious objector, he single-handedly saved more than 75 wounded men during the Battle of Okinawa. 2 hrs. 11 R (intense prolonged graphic sequences of war violence, including grisly bloody images) - T.D.\n",
      "The Handmaiden Based on Sarah Water's novel The Fingersmith, this breathtaking, clever, funny, sexy - and sexually graphic - romantic thriller from Oldboy director Park Chan-wook is about a lesbian romance that develops between an impoverished confidence trickster and an isolated, naïve heiress. 2 hrs. 24 No MPAA rating (nudity and graphic sexual situations throughout, profanity, smoking, violence) - T.D.\n",
      "Manchester by the Sea Kenneth Lonergan (You Can Count on Me, Margaret) proves once again he's one of America's finest dramatists with this working-class drama about loss, grief, and family obligations. Casey Affleck is sensational in an Oscar-worthy performance as a self-hating melancholic who has lived a miserable life as a janitor since he lost both his children in an accident. When his older brother (Kyle Chandler) dies, he must return to his tiny hometown and assume responsibility for his teenage nephew (Lucas Hedges). 2 hrs. 17 R (profanity throughout and some sexual content) - T.D.\n",
      "Moana This delightful, lyrical, and deeply moving 3D computer-animated family picture is a semicomic adventure story featuring the first truly feminist heroine to grace Walt Disney's animated features. Based in part on Polynesian myths, it's about a teenage princess (15-year-old Hawaii-born singer Auli'i Cravalho) who goes on an arduous journey to restore the creative powers of the fecund earth mother who created the world. Co-starring Dwayne Johnson as a macho demigod, the film is fueled by a wondrous ecofeminist point of view. 1 hr. 53 PG (peril, some scary images and brief thematic elements) - T.D.\n",
      "Also on screens The Accountant *** Crime thriller specialist Gavin O'Connor (Hope and Glory) delivers a slick, well-paced actioner based on the most ludicrous premise. Ben Affleck stars as an autistic accountant who also happens to be an expert sniper and martial arts master who is targeted by assassins after he finds financial irregularities at a powerful tech firm. Anna Kendrick is terrific as a geeky junior accountant who falls for the heroic CPA. With John Lithgow, J.K. Simmons, and Cynthia Addai-Robinson. 2 hr. 8 R (strong violence and profanity throughout) - T.D.\n",
      "Allied ** Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump) pays tribute to classic Hollywood films with this subpar romantic WWII spy yarn starring Brad Pitt as a commando who parachutes into Casablanca to help an agent from the French Resistance (Marion Cotillard). The derivative story is so far-fetched and the romance so tepid the film lacks any real vitality. 2 hrs. 04 R (violence, some sexuality/nudity, profanity, and brief drug use) - T.D.\n",
      "Almost Christmas **1/2 Finally, a decent role for Mo'Nique after her Oscar for 2009's Precious. Writer/director David E. Talbert turns the cameras on and lets her do her thing as the eccentric, motormouth Aunt May of the Meyers clan as the family works through all the familiar tropes of the holiday movie genre. 1 hr. 52 PG-13 (suggestive material, drug content, and language) - W.S. \n",
      "Bad Santa 2 **1/2 In long-in-coming sequel to 2003 hit, safecracking Santa Billy Bob Thornton and elfin sidekick Tony Cox try to knock over a Chicago charity. Kathy Bates is here, too, and the cast is in fine form – but the rehashed jokes feel way past their prime. 1 hr. 32 R (crude sexual content and language throughout, some graphic nudity) - W.S.\n",
      "Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk ** Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain) directs this ambitious and deeply flawed look at the differences between the public perception of war and what actually happens in battle. 1 hr. 50 R (language throughout, some war violence, sexual content, and brief drug use) - T.D.\n",
      "Bleed for This **1/2 By-the-numbers boxing biopic tells the story of world champion boxer Vinny \"the Pazmanian Devil\" Paz as he attempts to recover from a head-on car wreck and fight again.

      "The Edge of Seventeen *** A teen's (Hailee Steinfeld) life takes a turn for the worse when her best friend begins dating her brother. It works because it's not a candy-coated version of teenagedom. 1 hr. 30 R (for sexual content, language, and some drinking) - M.E. \n",
      "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them *** Harry Potter spin-off scripted by J.K. Rowling brings the wizarding world across the pond to our side. Set in 1920s Manhattan, with Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Colin Farrell. 2 hrs. 13 PG-13 (for some fantasy-action violence) - T.D.\n",
      "Nocturnal Animals *** In intense, haunting, convoluted movie – and movie-within-a-movie – Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal star as a divorced couple whose relationship takes a dark turn after he writes a novel. 1 hr. 56 R (violence, obscenity, and graphic nudity) - W.S.\n",
      "Rules Don't Apply * Warren Beatty stars as famously reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes in what is essentially a love story between a starry-eyed ingenue (Lily Collins) signed to Hughes' stable of aspiring actresses and a young, ambitious Hughes employee (Alden Ehrenreich). 2 hr. 6 PG-13 (sexual material including brief strong language, thematic elements, drug references) - W.S.\n",
      "Seasons *** Documentary filmmakers Jacques Perrin and Jacques Cluzaud ( Winged Migration) have shot stunning footage while following an assortment of animals in continental Europe, showing how they have adapted over different periods in our planet's history and how humans upend the balance of life, especially through industrialization and war. 1 hr. 35 PG (some violent imagery that may disturb young viewers) - W.S.\n",
      "Trolls ** DreamWorks Animation's mediocre animated 3D musical family adventure is the first big-screen story spun from the Good Luck Troll line of toys introduced in 1959. Justin Timberlake and Anna Kendrick voice the two leads and sing a couple of nice duets. Timberlake, who produced the music, does a great job, but the film has no magic, no real luster. 1 hr. 32 PG (some mild rude humor) - T.D....\n",

      "Down to Earth but Rising\n",
      "Publisher: The New York Times\n",
      "Date: 1999-10-10\n",
      "Section: Section 2; ; Section 2; Page 22; Column 5; Arts and Leisure Desk ; Column 5; ; Biography\n",
      "Length: 680 words words\n",
      "Body preview: ALEC Baldwin, who should know, says that 23-year-old Shawn Hatosy is ready for stardom: \"He has that quality you have to have in America to be a movie star -- half altar boy, half bank robber.\"\n",
      "Mr. Hatosy, who played Mr. Baldwin's mischievous son in the recently released \"Outside Providence,\" was the off-duty altar boy on a recent evening. Lounging in an armchair in gray corduroys and a T-shirt, he was drinking Coke and looking too down-to-earth to be in the sleek hotel bar chosen by his publicist. He seemed a little self-conscious in the interview seat, but he took his time answering questions, turned off his cell phone when it rang and practiced being the cooperative young actor.\n",
      "On Nov. 12, he will be seen as Natalie Portman's lovable best friend in Wayne Wang's \"Anywhere but Here,\" which stars Susan Sarandon. Then, in January, he'll be in two releases: as Nick Nolte's rambunctious teen-age self in the screen version of Sam Shepard's \"Simpatico\" and as an impressionable college student in Kris Isacsson's comedy, \"Down to You.\"\n",
      "Those who have worked with Mr. Hatosy say it's his sweet-tough image and his ability to come off as a real person that give the young actor his appeal. \"He's avoided the trap so far of that 'I'm so cool I give myself a nosebleed,' like too many of these little kids in Hollywood,\" said his director on \"Outside Providence,\" Michael Corrente. Casting Mr. Hatosy in his first leading role, as a working-class renegade who gets shipped off to prep school and then wins the girl of his dreams, Mr. Corrente admired the young actor's ease. \"He's found a way to keep it simple,\" Mr. Corrente said. \"His talent is being honest and sincere.\"\n",
      "Mr. Wang concurs: \"He is just such a solid, natural actor -- I don't think he tries to act. Everything he seems to do just feels right.\"\n",
      "Growing up in suburban Maryland, Mr. Hatosy played sports, sang in a band and, from the age of 10, was always in a school play. He flunked out of community college after one semester and decided to pursue his Hollywood dreams, landing work in episodes of \"Homicide\" and a bit part in Jodie Foster's 1995 comedy, \"Home for the Holidays.\"\n",
      "\"That's when I said, 'I've got a couple credits here, I'm bad,' \" he recalled, flashing his crooked-tooth grin. \"I'm going to New York.\"\n",
      "Soon after came his big break -- as the loyal student who stands up for Kevin Kline in \"In and Out\" by pretending to be gay. He said he had to fight for that role, and wasn't sorry he had. \"It was, like, 'Whoa! I'm a supporting actor with, like, the best cast at the time that I could imagine -- Kevin Kline, Joan Cusack and Matt Dillon. It was very incredible.\"\n",
      "Since then, Mr. Hatosy has moved to Los Angeles and has built his resume by taking on small roles alongside top-notch talent. \"It really hones your skills to be able to watch wonderful people,\" he said. \"If it means taking a smaller part, then I'd much rather do that than the teen flavor-of-the-moment. Natalie Portman, Susan Sarandon and Wayne Wang is the kind of group I want to run around with.\"\n",
      "Mr. Wang said that while Mr. Hatosy's sweetness in \"In and Out\" intrigued him, it was a glimpse of his darker side that won him over. \"He felt like Sean Penn on tape,\" Mr. Wang said of Mr. Hatosy's audition for \"Anywhere But Here.\"\n",
      "\"Ultimately we didn't end up playing his character too much that way, but there is a streak of that in him,\" Mr. Wang said. \"He's been cast too much in the sweet teen-ager role, but I think he'll grow out of it.\"\n",
      "In December, Mr. Hatosy will star in an HBO feature called \"Witness Protection\" with Forest Whitaker, and he has just finished his first full-out comic role, in \"Down to You,\" with Freddie Prinze Jr. He said he would like to work with Sean Penn, his favorite actor, and he hesitantly admitted that he has been developing several screenplay ideas.\n",
      "\"I'd like to have a production company; I'd love to have a theater career,\" Mr. Hatosy said, glancing into the distant horizon. \"That would be cool. I just want to keep working. I mean, it makes me very happy. I wouldn't be able to do anything else.\"\n",

      "Title: FILM: CAINE AND GEILGUD IN 'THE WHISTLE BLOWER'\n",
      "Publisher: The New York Times\n",
      "Date: 1987-07-10\n",
      "Section: Section C; Page 4, Column 2; Weekend Desk; Review\n",
      "Length: 839 words words\n",
      "Body preview: A NUMBER of killings occur during ''The Whistle Blower,'' Simon Langton's film about a British spy ring. But there is only one gun to be seen here, glimpsed briefly in one of the film's last scenes, and for the most part it stays inside a drawer. ''The Whistle Blower'' eschews the usual equipment to be found in spy stories, and the usual attitudes too. While its intrigue plot is indeed suspenseful and tight, this film's real focus is on British society and its stratification. Mr. Langton, Julian Bond, the film's screenwriter (who also wrote ''The Shooting Party'') and an outstandingly fine cast explore these distinctions deftly.\n",
      "The film traces the efforts by one man, Frank Jones, an office-equipment salesman played by Michael Caine, to unravel the intrigue that has enveloped his idealistic young son. Bob Jones (played by Nigel Havers, who was young Lord Lindsey in ''Chariots of Fire'') works as a Russian translator in the Government office where a fellow employee has recently been convicted of spying. When Frank comes to visit him on his birthday, the son voices his dissatisfaction.\n",
      "He loves the Russian language, Russian literature, and hates using his expertise to study tapped telephone conversations by Communist Party officials. He hates feeling, when the Bolshoi Ballet comes to town, ''the certainty that the K.G.B. man is sitting in the bloody prop corner.'' He hates the climate of mistrust and suspicion in which his work is done. ''Their secret world has put out the light of the ordinary world,'' he says.\n",
      "Bob sees a number of his colleagues perish under peculiar circumstances, as part of the aftermath of the spy scandal. When he himself has a suspicious accident, his father cannot help but try to find out what happened. Frank, a widower and Korean War veteran who values ''the quiet life at the end of the day,'' is gradually enraged and astonished by what he learns of his son's fate and the circumstances that have shaped it. And he is goaded into action by the air of secrecy that surrounds even Bob's friends and co-workers. ''We've got our jobs and our futures too, you know,'' one woman responds to inquiries from this bereaved man.\n",
      "''The Whistle Blower,'' which opens today at the 68th Street Playhouse, has been directed in a swift, economical and nicely detailed style by Mr. Langton; only in its final scenes, when the underlying cynicism gives way to obviousness, does the film loosen its grip. As based on a novel by John Hale, it has an intricate plot that hinges indirectly on matters of class and position. These little issues arise everywhere: in the way an elderly aristocrat tries to commandeer a parking place from an impudent left-wing journalist (Kenneth Colley), in Frank's meeting with an old wartime buddy (Barry Foster) who has come up in the world; in the attitude of a high-born British Intelligence official (James Fox) toward those who are less so. Mr. Fox, addressing a more working-class colleague in a scene that takes place at the races, manages to give orders without meeting the other man's eyes at all.\n",
      "At the pinnacle of the film's social microcosm is Sir Adrian Chapple, a gentlemanly Government leader played by Sir John Gielgud as the full embodiment of the screenplay's disillusionment. By contrast, Mr. Caine plays Frank as a resolutely ordinary man, a firm believer in stability and the simple virtues. Frank, at first shocked by his son's daring to complain about a steady job, eventually has his thinking reshaped by the hard facts that unfold before him. Mr. Caine captures this process in its every small nuance, conveying the man's bitterness, his quiet anguish and above all his tenacity.\n",
      "As headed by Mr. Caine, who gives a full and affecting performance well above his usual high level, the film's entire cast is a marvel. Every last role in this complex and crowded story is well played; even the walk-on parts, the police detectives and office workers, become memorable. Like the actors, the varied and believable sets contribute greatly to the film's crisp and definite manner, helping to shape the small, tense universe in which the action unfolds. ''It's a flight from reality,'' one character says about the world of espionage. But as evoked so well here, it has a reality of its own.\n",
      "''The Whistler Blower'' is rated PG (''Parental Guidance Suggested''). It contains some violence, most of it implicit, and mildly strong language. Working-Class War THE WHISTLE BLOWER, directed by Simon Langton; screenplay by Julian Bond, based on the novel by John Hale; director of photography, Fred Tammes; edited by Bob Morgan; production designer, Morley Smith; produced by Geoffrey Reeve; released by Hemdale Releasing Corporation.
